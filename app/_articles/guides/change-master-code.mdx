## Quick Answer

**To change master code: Open app → Settings → Master Code → Enter current code → Enter new code (6-8 digits, not 1234) → Confirm → Save → Test immediately on keypad.** Change after: installation, employee departure, relationship end, or suspected compromise. Never reuse old codes. Choose random 6-8 digits, store in password manager.

**When to change:**
- After installation  - from default
- After giving to ex-user
- After suspected compromise
- Every 90 days  - high security

## Why Change Master Code

### Critical Scenarios

**MUST change immediately:**
- Ex-employee knows it
- Relationship ended
- Roommate moved out
- Suspected compromise
- Shared with wrong person

**SHOULD change:**
- Never changed from default
- Too simple  - 1234, 0000
- Over 1 year old
- Too many people know it

## Step-by-Step Change

### Via App

```
1. Open lock app
2. Settings → Master Code
3. Enter current code
4. Enter new code (6-8 digits)
5. Confirm new code
6. Save
7. Wait 30-60 seconds (sync)
8. Test at keypad immediately
```

**Time:** 2-3 minutes

## Strong Code Guidelines

**Good codes:**
- 582047  - random
- 793514  - random
- 6-8 digits minimum

**Bad codes:**
- 123456  - most common
- 000000  - too simple
- Birthday/address

**Generate:**
- Password manager
- Dice rolls
- Random generator

## After Changing

```
□ Test new code 3×
□ Store in password manager
□ Update authorized users
□ Delete old documentation
□ Update emergency contacts
```

## Brand Specifics

**Yale:** App → Master Code → Change
**Schlage:** Programming Code (not Master)
**Kwikset:** Master User → Change
**August:** Admin via app (no traditional master code)

## Security Best Practices

```
☑ Change from default on day 1
☑ Use 6-8 random digits
☑ Store in password manager
☑ Don't share unless necessary
☑ Change after any user leaves
☑ Rotate every 90 days (high security)
☑ Never write on sticky note
```

## Troubleshooting

**New code doesn't work:**
- Wait 2 minutes  - sync time
- Enter slowly  - check beeps
- Verify in app  - shows new code
- Try old code  - may not have changed

**Locked out:**
- Use backup key
- 9V emergency power
- Factory reset  - last resort

## Communication

**Tell current users:**
```
"New door code: [XXXXX]
Please memorize and delete this message."
```

**Don't tell ex-users:**
- They don't need to know
- Just change it

## When to Change

**Immediate:**
- Installation
- User termination
- Relationship end
- Compromise suspected

**Routine:**
- Every 3-6 months  - normal security
- Every 90 days  - high security
- Every 30 days  - ultra-high security
