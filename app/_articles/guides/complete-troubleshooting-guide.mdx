## Problem #2: Connection Issues (18% of Problems)

### Symptom: "Unable to Connect to Lock" Error

**What You See**:
- App shows "Connecting..." then "Connection Failed"
- Lock physically works  - keypad, manual key
- Previously connected successfully
- Error message: "Check network connection" or "Lock offline"

**Quick Fix Decision Tree**:

```
START: App cannot connect to lock

Q1: Does keypad still work?
├─ YES → Lock is powered, issue is connectivity
│         Go to Q2
│
└─ NO → Lock is dead
         → Try battery replacement first

Q2: Is lock WiFi-enabled?
├─ YES (WiFi lock) → Go to WiFi troubleshooting
│         Common: August, Schlage Encode, Kwikset Halo
│
└─ NO (BLE/Z-Wave/Zigbee) → Go to Hub troubleshooting
          Common: Yale Assure (no WiFi), Schlage Connect
```

**WiFi Lock Troubleshooting:**

```
Step 1: Check phone's BLE/WiFi
├─ Phone → Settings → Bluetooth: ON?
├─ Phone → Settings → WiFi: ON and connected?
└─ Phone location services: Enabled for lock app?

Step 2: Reboot phone
├─ Power off phone completely (not just lock screen)
├─ Wait 30 seconds
├─ Power on
└─ Try app again (Success rate: 40%)

Step 3: Reboot lock
├─ Remove batteries
├─ Wait 30 seconds (clears lock's memory)
├─ Reinstall batteries
├─ Wait for lock to initialize (30-60 seconds)
├─ LED should flash (indicates boot complete)
└─ Try app (Success rate: 70% cumulative)

Step 4: Check WiFi network
├─ Lock only supports 2.4GHz WiFi (NOT 5GHz)
├─ Router → Settings: Is 2.4GHz enabled?
├─ Common issue: Dual-band routers auto-select 5GHz for new devices
└─ Solution: Manually connect lock to 2.4GHz SSID

Step 5: Re-pair lock to WiFi
├─ App → Settings → WiFi Setup → Forget Network
├─ Lock → Physical reset button (hold 10 seconds)
├─ App → Add Device → Follow pairing wizard
└─ Success rate: 90% cumulative
```

**Hub-Based Lock Troubleshooting:**

```
Step 1: Check hub power/status
├─ Hub LED indicator: Solid green equals good, red/off equals problem
├─ Hub power adapter: Plugged in? Outlet working?
└─ If hub offline: Power cycle hub (unplug 30 sec, plug in)

Step 2: Check hub internet connection
├─ Hub → Ethernet cable: Plugged in securely?
├─ Router → Check hub has IP address assigned
└─ Hub app: Shows "Online" status?

Step 3: Check lock-to-hub connection
├─ Distance: Lock >30 feet from hub? (Z-Wave/Zigbee max ~100 ft)
├─ Obstacles: Metal objects, water heaters, large appliances between lock & hub?
├─ Solution: Move hub closer OR add repeater
└─ Test: Temporarily move hub to same room as lock

Step 4: Re-pair lock to hub
├─ App → Devices → Lock → Remove Device
├─ Lock → Physical reset (varies by model, usually hold button 10 sec)
├─ App → Add Device → Scan for new devices
├─ Lock should appear within 60 seconds
└─ Success rate: 95% cumulative
```

**Still Not Working - Advanced Steps:**

1. **Check router firewall**:
   - Some routers block smart home device communication
   - Router → Settings → Firewall → Add exception for lock/hub IP
   - Or: Put lock/hub in DMZ (less secure but eliminates firewall issues)

2. **2.4GHz WiFi congestion**:
   - Download "WiFi Analyzer" app (Android) or "Airport Utility" (iOS)
   - Check channel congestion (channels 1, 6, 11 are best)
   - Router → Settings → WiFi Channel → Manually select least congested

3. **IP address conflict**:
   - Rare but possible: Two devices assigned same IP
   - Router → DHCP Settings → Reserve IP for lock/hub
   - Or: Reboot router (clears all assignments)

### Symptom: Intermittent Connection (Works Sometimes)

**What You See**:
- Lock connects successfully 50-80% of attempts
- Other times: "Connection timeout" or very slow  - 30+ seconds
- Pattern: Worse at certain times of day OR after specific events

**Root Causes**:

| Cause | Symptoms | Solution | Success Rate |
|-------|----------|----------|--------------|
| **Weak signal** | Worse when farther from hub/router | Move hub closer, add repeater | 90% |
| **2.4GHz interference** | Worse 6-9pm (neighbors home using WiFi), microwave running | Change WiFi channel, use 5GHz for other devices | 70% |
| **Battery low** | Worse when battery <30% | Replace batteries | 100% |
| **Loose battery contact** | Pattern: Works after jiggling lock/door | Clean battery contacts, bend contact springs slightly | 85% |
| **Firmware bug** | Started after firmware update | Rollback firmware OR wait for fix | 60% |

## Problem #3: Mechanical Issues (22% of Problems)

### Symptom: Lock Motor Runs But Doesn't Unlock/Lock

**What You See**:
- Hear motor sound  - whirring/buzzing
- Lock attempts to turn but fails
- Error message: "Lock jammed" or "Motor stalled"
- Manual key override works fine

**Root Cause**: Mechanical misalignment (85% of cases)

**Solution - Door Alignment Check**:

```
Step-by-Step Alignment Fix:

1. Identify the problem
   ├─ Close door (don't lock yet)
   ├─ Manually turn deadbolt (use thumb turn or key)
   ├─ Does it turn smoothly? 
   │   ├─ YES → Problem is electronic (not mechanical)
   │   └─ NO → Proceed to Step 2

2. Check strike plate alignment
   ├─ Open door
   ├─ Extend deadbolt fully
   ├─ Slowly close door (don't force)
   ├─ Does deadbolt slide into strike plate hole easily?
   │   ├─ YES → Strike plate OK, check door frame (Step 3)
   │   └─ NO → Strike plate misaligned (Step 4)

3. Check door sag (common in old doors)
   ├─ Stand back, look at door
   ├─ Top corner closer to frame than bottom? (door sags)
   ├─ Test: Lift door handle while locking
   │   ├─ Works when lifted? → Door hinge sag (Step 5)
   │   └─ Doesn't help? → Strike plate issue (Step 4)

4. Adjust strike plate (most common fix)
   ├─ Tools needed: Phillips screwdriver, pencil
   ├─ Close door, mark where deadbolt hits frame (pencil)
   ├─ Open door, locate strike plate
   ├─ Is pencil mark centered in strike plate hole?
   │   ├─ Mark above hole → Move strike plate UP
   │   ├─ Mark below hole → Move strike plate DOWN
   │   ├─ Mark left/right of hole → Adjust horizontally
   │
   ├─ Loosen strike plate screws (don't remove)
   ├─ Slide plate to align with mark
   ├─ Tighten screws
   ├─ Test: Does deadbolt slide in smoothly now?
   │   ├─ YES → Fixed! Tighten screws fully
   │   └─ NO → May need to file strike plate hole larger (call professional)

5. Fix door hinge sag
   ├─ Tighten all hinge screws (top, middle, bottom)
   ├─ If screws spin (stripped holes):
   │   ├─ Remove screw
   │   ├─ Insert toothpicks or matchsticks into hole
   │   ├─ Break off flush with surface
   │   ├─ Reinsert screw (will bite into wood)
   │
   ├─ If door still sags:
   │   ├─ Install longer screws in top hinge (3" instead of 1")
   │   ├─ This pulls door up slightly
   │
   ├─ Test lock again

6. Lubricate (if binding detected)
   ├─ DO NOT use WD-40 or oil (attracts dust, gums up)
   ├─ USE: Dry graphite powder or PTFE spray
   ├─ Spray into keyhole, on deadbolt
   ├─ Work lock back and forth 10 times
   ├─ Wipe excess

Success Rate by Step:
- Step 4  - Strike plate adjust: 70%
- Step 5  - Hinge tighten: 85% cumulative
- Step 6  - Lubricate: 90% cumulative
- If still failing: Call locksmith  - 10% require professional

## Real-World Troubleshooting Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Intermittent Connectivity (Airbnb Host)

**Problem Report:**
```
Host manages 3 Airbnb units with smart locks
Issue: Locks work for 2-3 days, then stop responding
Pattern: Always fails on checkout day (Murphy's Law)
Tried: Replaced batteries twice, still fails
```

**Investigation:**
```
Day 1-2: Commands work perfectly (99% success)
Day 3-4: Commands slow (3-5 sec response)
Day 5+: Commands fail (timeout errors)
```

**Root Cause Discovery:**
- Checked battery voltage: 1.48V (should be 1.5V+)
- Batteries were generic brand, voltage drop under load
- Lock draws 200mA during unlock (voltage sags to 1.2V)
- WiFi module brownout when voltage <1.3V
- Intermittent failures correlate with battery sag

**Solution:**
```
Switched to Energizer Ultimate Lithium:
├─ Voltage under load: 1.65V (stable)
├─ No voltage sag even at 6 months old
├─ Cost: $12/4-pack vs $4 alkaline
└─ Result: Zero failures in 8 months

ROI calculation:
├─ Lost bookings from lockouts: 2 per month × $150 = $300/month
├─ Emergency locksmith: $200/incident × 2 = $400/month
├─ Lithium batteries: $8/month more expensive
└─ Net savings: $692/month by using quality batteries
```

**Lesson**: Battery brand matters more than expected for high-reliability applications.

### Case Study 2: Ghost Unlocks (Security Concern)

**Problem Report:**
```
Homeowner receives notifications:
"Front door unlocked at 3:47 AM"
No one home, no codes entered
Happens 2-3 times per week
Security concern - is someone breaking in?
```

**Investigation:**
```
Review audit logs:
├─ All unlocks show "Auto-unlock" as source
├─ No user codes, no app commands
├─ Times: Always 3:00-4:00 AM
└─ No physical evidence of entry

Check automation rules:
├─ No scheduled automations at that time
├─ Geofence automation enabled
└─ Geofence radius: 500 feet
```

**Root Cause:**
```
Phone location glitch:
├─ Phone GPS drift at night (common iOS/Android issue)
├─ Location jumps outside geofence
├─ App thinks user "left home"
├─ User "returns" (GPS corrects)
├─ Geofence triggers "unlock on arrival"
└─ Lock unlocks at 3 AM (no one actually arriving)
```

**Solutions Tested:**
```
Option 1: Disable geofence automation
├─ Result: Problem solved but lost convenience
└─ Verdict: Not ideal

Option 2: Add time restriction to geofence
├─ Only allow geofence unlock 6 AM - 11 PM
├─ Result: Problem solved, keep convenience
└─ Verdict: BEST solution

Option 3: Increase geofence radius to 1000 feet
├─ Reduces false triggers from GPS drift
├─ Result: 80% reduction in ghost unlocks
└─ Verdict: Good backup
```

**Final Configuration:**
```
Geofence automation:
├─ Enable: Monday-Friday 6:00 AM - 10:00 PM
├─ Radius: 750 feet (compromise)
├─ Require WiFi connected to home network (double-check)
└─ Result: Zero false unlocks in 6 months
```

**Lesson**: Automation rules need safeguards, especially for security-critical actions like unlocking.

## Advanced Troubleshooting Techniques

### Network Packet Analysis (Advanced Users)

**When to use:** Persistent connectivity issues, mysterious timeouts

**Tools needed:**
- Wireshark or tcpdump (free network analysis tools)
- Access to router admin panel
- Basic understanding of network protocols

**Procedure:**
```
1. Capture network traffic from lock
   ├─ Router admin → Traffic capture or port mirroring
   ├─ Capture for 5 minutes during problem
   ├─ Save pcap file
   
2. Analyze traffic in Wireshark
   ├─ Filter for lock's MAC address
   ├─ Look for patterns:
   │   ├─ Retransmissions (slow network)
   │   ├─ TCP resets (connection failures)
   │   ├─ DNS failures (can't reach cloud)
   │   └─ ICMP unreachable (routing problems)
   
3. Common findings:
   ├─ High packet loss (>5%): WiFi interference
   ├─ DNS timeouts: Router DNS issues
   ├─ TLS handshake failures: Clock drift on lock
   └─ Persistent retries: Firewall blocking
```

**Real Example:**
```
Lock kept disconnecting every 2-3 hours

Packet capture revealed:
├─ Lock sending keepalive every 30 minutes
├─ Router responding normally
├─ But: Router ARP cache expiring after 90 minutes
├─ Lock not responding to ARP requests (sleep mode)
└─ Router marking lock as offline

Fix:
├─ Increase router ARP timeout to 12 hours
├─ OR: Configure lock to wake up for ARP
└─ Result: Stable connection for months
```

### Firmware Debugging Mode

**For stubborn firmware issues:**

Some locks have hidden diagnostic modes:

**Yale Locks:**
```
Enter diagnostic mode:
├─ Remove batteries
├─ Hold gear button
├─ Install batteries while holding (10 sec)
├─ LED flashes special pattern
└─ Diagnostic mode active

Features:
├─ Verbose error reporting
├─ Component self-test
├─ Battery voltage readout
└─ Exit: Remove batteries again
```

**Schlage Locks:**
```
Press sequence:
├─ Schlage button
├─ 1-2-3-4-5-6
├─ Schlage button
├─ LED code indicates internal state

LED patterns:
├─ Rapid red flash: Motor fault
├─ Slow red flash: Communication fault
├─ Alternating red/green: Firmware corrupted
└─ Solid green: Hardware OK, firmware issue
```

### Multi-Lock Fleet Troubleshooting

**Managing issues across 10+ locks:**

**Problem:** 3 out of 50 locks offline, which ones need attention?

**Dashboard approach:**
```
Create monitoring spreadsheet:

Lock ID | Location | Last Seen | Battery % | Alerts | Status
--------|----------|-----------|-----------|--------|--------
L001    | Unit 1A  | 2 min ago | 87%       | 0      | ✅ OK
L002    | Unit 1B  | 5 min ago | 23%       | 1      | ⚠️ Low batt
L003    | Unit 2A  | 45 min    | 65%       | 0      | ⚠️ Check conn
L004    | Unit 2B  | 3 hours   | Unknown   | 5      | ❌ OFFLINE

Priority response:
├─ L004: Immediate attention (offline >1 hour)
├─ L002: Schedule battery replacement (this week)
├─ L003: Monitor (investigate if >2 hours)
└─ L001: Nominal
```

**Bulk diagnostics:**
```
Morning routine (10 minutes for 50 locks):
├─ Export lock status from management platform
├─ Filter for:
│   ├─ Battery <30%: Add to replacement schedule
│   ├─ Last seen >1 hour: Investigate immediately
│   ├─ Error count >0: Review error log
│   └─ Low RSSI (<-75 dBm): Consider adding router
├─ Prioritize critical doors (entrances, exits)
└─ Create work orders for identified issues
```

**Proactive vs reactive:**
```
Reactive approach (traditional):
├─ Wait for tenant complaint
├─ Emergency locksmith call: $200
├─ Tenant dissatisfaction
└─ Time to resolution: 2-4 hours

Proactive approach (monitoring):
├─ Identify issue before failure (battery at 25%)
├─ Scheduled maintenance visit: $0 (regular rounds)
├─ Replace battery before it dies
├─ Time to resolution: 0 (prevented failure)
└─ Result: 85% reduction in emergency calls
```
