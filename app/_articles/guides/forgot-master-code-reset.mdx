## Quick Answer

**If you forgot master code: Use app to view or change code (if you have app access), OR use backup physical key to enter, OR factory reset lock (last resort - erases all codes).** Factory reset process varies by brand but typically: Hold reset button 10-20 seconds until beep/flash. After reset, set new master code immediately.

**Recovery options (try in order):**
1. 🔴 **View code in app** (if you have admin access) - Instant
2. 🟡 **Use backup physical key** (if equipped) - 2 minutes
3. 🟠 **Factory reset lock** (last resort) - 10 minutes, erases everything

## Recovery Methods

### Method 1: View Master Code in App (Best Option)

**If you still have app access:**

```
This is the easiest solution - you may have forgotten code but app still knows it.

□ Open smart lock app
□ Select your lock
□ Go to Users / Codes / Settings
□ Find "Master Code" or "Admin Code"
□ Tap "Show" or "View Code"
  - May require Face ID / Touch ID / Password
  
□ Code displayed: ________

□ Test code on keypad immediately
□ Write down code in secure location
```

**Time:** 1-2 minutes

**This works if:**
- ✅ You have admin access to app
- ✅ Lock is online
- ✅ You remember app login

**This doesn't work if:**
- ❌ Lost phone  - no app access
- ❌ Forgot app password
- ❌ Lock offline  - can't retrieve from cloud

### Method 2: Use Backup Physical Key

**If lock has key backup:**

```
Most smart locks include physical key as backup.

□ Locate backup key
  - Should be on your keyring
  - OR: Given to you at installation
  - OR: Stored in safe location

□ Find keyway on lock
  - Usually below handle (Schlage, Kwikset)
  - Above handle (Yale)
  - Behind decorative cap (some models)

□ Insert key and unlock
  - Works even with dead battery
  - Mechanical override

□ Once inside:
  - Access app to view/reset master code
  - OR: Perform factory reset from interior
```

**Time:** 2-5 minutes

**If you lost backup key:**
- Order replacement from manufacturer  - $10-20
- Call locksmith to pick lock  - $100-150
- Factory reset from interior  - if accessible

### Method 3: Change Code via App

**If you have app access but code not visible:**

```
Some apps don't show code but allow changing it.

□ App → Lock → Users → Master Code
□ Tap "Change Code" or "Reset Code"
□ Enter new code: ________
□ Confirm new code
□ Save

□ Wait 2-5 minutes for sync

□ Test new code on keypad
```

**Time:** 5 minutes

### Method 4: Factory Reset (Last Resort)

**Warning:** Erases ALL codes and settings

**Only do this if:**
- ❌ No app access
- ❌ No backup key
- ❌ Other methods failed

**General factory reset process:**

```
From INTERIOR side:

  - May be labeled "Reset" or "Program"

□ Press and HOLD reset button

  - All settings reset
  - Unpaired from hub/app

□ Set new master code immediately
  - Follow manufacturer instructions
  - Usually: Enter programming mode → Set code

□ Re-pair with hub/app

```

  - Store in secure cloud (not phone gallery)
```
