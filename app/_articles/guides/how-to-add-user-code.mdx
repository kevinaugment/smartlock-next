## Quick Answer: The Sync-Test Imperative

**User code addition follows universal five-minute procedure across brands: navigate to Users/Codes section in lock app, create new entry with descriptive name and 4-8 digit PIN, configure access schedule (permanent or time-bounded), save configuration, wait 2-5 minutes for cloud-to-lock synchronization, then immediately test code on physical keypad before communicating credentials to intended user.** The test-before-sharing protocol proves mandatory rather than optional: premature code distribution creates lockout scenarios when synchronization failures go undetected until guest arrival, transforming preventable technical issues into emergency access crises.

The synchronization delay—2-5 minutes typical, occasionally extending to 10 minutes for weak connectivity—represents unavoidable cloud architecture latency where app configuration updates must propagate through vendor servers to lock firmware. Users attempting immediate code testing (<30 seconds post-save) invariably encounter "invalid code" responses misinterpreted as configuration errors rather than incomplete synchronization, triggering unnecessary troubleshooting and repeated code recreation that compounds rather than resolves delays.

## Before You Start

### Requirements Checklist

```☑️ Lock must be online (check app status)
☑️ You have admin access (not guest user)
☑️ Know desired PIN code (4-8 digits)
☑️ Battery level >20% (low battery equals sync issues)
☑️ Phone connected to internet
```
### Choose PIN Code

**Good PIN codes:**
- 4-8 digits  - most locks
- Not obvious  - 1234, 0000, 1111
- Not birthday or address
- Unique per user

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Sequential  - 1234, 5678
- ❌ Repeating  - 1111, 2222
- ❌ Too short if lock allows longer  - use 6+ digits
- ❌ Same code for multiple users

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Open User Management

```Most apps:
- Open smart lock app
- Select your lock (if multiple)
- Tap "Users" or "Access Codes" or "People"
- Tap "+ Add" or "Add User" or "Create Code"
```
**Common app flows:**
- **Yale Access:** Tap lock → Keypad Code → Add Code
- **Schlage Home:** Tap lock → Access Codes → Add Access Code
- **Kwikset:** Tap lock → Users → Add User
- **August:** Tap lock → Access → Add Permanent Guest

### Step 2: Enter User Details

```- Name: Enter user's name
  - Examples: "John Smith", "Cleaner", "Airbnb Guest 3/15"
  - Be descriptive (helps identify later)
  
- PIN Code: Enter 4-8 digit code
  - Most locks: 4-6 digits
  - Some support up to 8 digits
  - App will show if code too short/long
  
- Access Type: Choose permanent or temporary
  - Permanent: No expiration
  - Temporary: Set start/end date & time
```
### Step 3: Set Schedule (Optional)

**Permanent access:**
```- Select "Always active" or "Permanent"
- Code never expires
- Good for: Family, long-term tenants
```
**Temporary access:**
```- Select "Temporary" or "Schedule"
- Set start date/time
  - Example: March 15, 2024, 3:00 PM
  
- Set end date/time
  - Example: March 20, 2024, 11:00 AM
  - ⚠️ Set to END of last day, not START of next day
  - Use 11:59 PM to avoid confusion
  
- Good for: Guests, contractors, one-time access
```
**Recurring schedule (advanced):**
```Some locks support:
- Days of week (Mon-Fri only)
- Time windows (9 AM - 5 PM only)
- Good for: Cleaners, dog walkers
```
### Step 4: Save and Sync

```- Tap "Save" or "Add" or "Create"
- App shows "Syncing..." or "Sending to lock"
- WAIT 2-5 minutes (don't close app)
  - WiFi locks: 30 seconds
  - Zigbee/Z-Wave: 1-2 minutes
  - Z-Wave S2: 2-5 minutes (DSK verification)
- App shows "Success" or "Synced" checkmark
```
**Sync troubleshooting:**
```If "Sending..." for >5 minutes:
- Check lock is online
- Wake up lock (press any button on keypad)
- Send lock/unlock command (triggers sync)
- Cancel and retry if still failing
```
### Step 5: Test Immediately

**Don't assume sync worked - always test:**

```- Go to lock keypad
- Enter new PIN code
- Press # or Enter (if required by your lock)
- Lock should beep and unlock

Success: ✅ Lock unlocks
Failure: ❌ Error beep or no response
  → Wait 2 more minutes and retry
  → Check code in app (view it, don't rely on memory)
  → Delete and re-add if still not working
```
## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Code Not Working After Adding

**Cause 1: Code not synced yet**
```Solution:
- Wait 5 minutes total
- Press any keypad button to wake lock
- Try code again
```
**Cause 2: Wrong code entered**
```Solution:
- Open app → Users → [Name] → View Code
- Verify you're entering exact code shown
- Enter slowly (2 seconds between digits)
```
**Cause 3: Lock offline when adding**
```Solution:
- Check lock status in app
- If offline: Fix connectivity first
- Delete code, wait for online, re-add
```
### Issue: Can't Add More Users

**Cause: User limit reached**

```Most locks support:
- Budget locks: 10-20 users
- Mid-range: 30-50 users
- Premium: 100-250 users

Solution:
- Delete unused codes first
- Check manual for your lock's limit
- Consider upgrading lock if need more
```
### Issue: Code Works But Expires Early

**Cause: End time misunderstood**

```Common mistake:
Set expiration: "March 20, 12:00 AM"
You think: Midnight END of March 20
Lock interprets: Midnight START of March 20
Result: Code expires 24 hours early!

Solution:
- Set expiration to END of day: "March 20, 11:59 PM"
- OR: Next day: "March 21, 12:00 AM"
- Always test before giving code to guest
```

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

**Good names:**
- "John Smith - Family"
- "Airbnb Guest - March 15-20"
- "Cleaner - Recurring Tue/Thu"
- "Contractor - One-time 3/15"

**Bad names:**
- "Guest 1"  - non-descriptive
- "1234"  - confusing
- Just first name  - multiple Johns?

### Code Management

```☑️ Use unique code per person (don't share)
☑️ Delete code immediately after use (temp guests)
☑️ Audit codes quarterly (remove old users)
☑️ Document codes securely (password manager)
☑️ Test codes before giving to guests
```
### Security Tips

```☑️ Don't reuse codes (after deletion, wait before reusing)
☑️ Change master code from default
☑️ Limit who has admin access
☑️ Enable notifications for new users added
☑️ Review access logs regularly
```
## Special Scenarios

### For Airbnb Hosts

```- Name code with dates: "Guest - Check-in 3/15"
- Set start time 1 hour before check-in
  - Buffer for early arrival
- Set end time 11:59 PM of checkout day
  - Not 12:00 AM next day (ambiguous)
- Test code day before guest arrives
- Auto-generate unique codes per booking
- Delete immediately after checkout
```
### For Office/Business

```- Assign codes by department or role
- Use recurring schedules (Mon-Fri, 9-5)
- Audit monthly (remove ex-employees)
- Require code change every 90 days
- Log all access (compliance)
```
### For Family/Roommates

```- Permanent codes (no expiration)
- Unique code per person
- Keep master code separate
- Communicate code changes promptly
```

## Summary: Test-Before-Share Protocol

User code addition represents straightforward administrative task requiring no technical expertise, yet operational reliability demands strict test-before-share discipline preventing distribution of unverified credentials that create lockout scenarios when synchronization failures manifest only upon guest arrival at property. The procedural execution proves trivially simple—navigate app to user management, enter name and PIN, configure schedule, save—but the verification requirement proves absolutely mandatory.

**Synchronization patience** prevents the most common user error: testing code immediately after saving (<30 seconds) before cloud-to-lock synchronization completes, encountering "invalid code" response, misinterpreting as configuration error rather than incomplete sync, then initiating unnecessary troubleshooting or recreation. The 2-5 minute wait (occasionally 10 minutes for weak signal) represents unavoidable cloud architecture latency that users must respect rather than circumvent.

**PIN selection discipline** avoids obvious codes (1234, 0000, birthdates) that compromise access security, instead deploying 6+ digit non-sequential patterns unique per user enabling accountability through access logs. Reusing codes across multiple users eliminates audit capability revealing WHO accessed WHEN—defeating primary smart lock advantage over mechanical keys.

**Temporal configuration precision** for temporary codes demands 11:59 PM expiration on LAST valid day rather than 12:00 AM next day, avoiding timezone and clock synchronization edge cases causing premature expiration creating guest lockouts. This one-minute configuration difference prevents majority of temporary code failures encountered in short-term rental operations.

**Verification testing** before credential distribution represents non-negotiable final step: personally test code on physical keypad, verify successful unlock, confirm access logs record entry with correct user attribution, only then communicate code to intended recipient. This protocol transforms preventable synchronization failures into detected issues resolved before user impact rather than discovered through guest lockout requiring emergency intervention.
