## Quick Answer: Acoustic Signature Failure Mode Analysis

**Motor noise acoustic signatures indicate specific failure modes through sound frequency and pattern: grinding (metal-on-metal friction from strike misalignment, 500-2000 Hz), rhythmic clicking (gear tooth skipping from wear, 5-20 Hz pulse), labored straining (insufficient torque from low battery, elevated current draw audible as 60 Hz hum), squealing (lack of lubrication, 2000-4000 Hz high-frequency).** Normal operation produces 30-40 dB smooth whirring (motor coil switching, 200-800 Hz broadband), abnormal sounds exceed 50 dB indicating mechanical stress requiring intervention preventing accelerated wear and eventual motor failure.

### Motor Sound Diagnostic Matrix

| Sound Signature | Frequency Range | Volume  - dB | Pattern | Primary Cause | Secondary Indicators | Fix Priority | Success Rate |
|----------------|----------------|-------------|---------|---------------|---------------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Normal Whir** | 200-800 Hz | 30-40 dB | Smooth, consistent | Proper operation | 2-3 sec duration, single end-click | N/A | N/A |
| **Grinding** | 500-2000 Hz | 50-65 dB | Continuous scraping | Strike misalignment  - 40% | Works better door-open, worse door-closed | High | 90% |
| **Clicking** | 5-20 Hz pulses | 45-55 dB | Rhythmic click-click | Gear wear  - 20% | Age >3 years, heavy use | Medium | 50% |
| **Labored Strain** | 60 Hz hum + mechanical | 55-70 dB | Struggling, slow | Low battery  - 25% | >5 sec operation, stops mid-cycle | High | 95% |
| **Squealing** | 2000-4000 Hz | 50-60 dB | High-pitch screech | Dry friction  - 10% | Recent cleaning/painting | Medium | 85% |

## Normal vs Abnormal Sounds

### Normal Operation

**Expected sounds:**
```
✓ Soft whirring (30-40 dB)
  - Like quiet electric drill
  - 2-3 seconds duration
  - Smooth and consistent

✓ Slight mechanical sound
  - Gears engaging
  - Deadbolt moving
  - Metal on metal (minimal)

✓ Final "click"
  - Deadbolt fully extends/retracts
  - Single click
  - End of cycle
```
**Volume test:** Can't hear over normal conversation

### Abnormal Sounds

**Problem indicators:**
```
✗ Loud grinding (>50 dB)
  - Like metal scraping
  - Continuous through cycle
  - Getting worse over time

✗ Rhythmic clicking
  - Click-click-click pattern
  - Gear teeth skipping
  - Uneven rotation

✗ Straining/laboring
  - Motor sounds like struggling
  - Takes 5+ seconds
  - May stop mid-cycle

✗ Squealing/screeching
  - High-pitched sound
  - Lack of lubrication
  - Excessive friction
```
## Common Causes

### 1. Misalignment (40%)

**Deadbolt hitting strike:**
```
Problem:
- Deadbolt tip catches edge of strike hole
- Motor pushes harder
- Grinding/clicking sound
- Excessive wear

Fix:
- Test with door open:
  - Does noise occur?
  - No equals Door/strike issue
  - Yes equals Internal issue

- Adjust strike plate:
  - File hole 1-2mm larger
  - OR reposition strike
  - Deadbolt should glide in

- Expected result:
  - Noise reduces 80%+
  - Smooth operation
  - No resistance
```
### 2. Low Battery (25%)

**Underpowered motor:**
```
Problem:
- Battery <30%
- Motor weak
- Struggles against friction
- Sounds labored

Symptoms:
- Progressively louder
- Takes longer to complete
- Sometimes stops mid-cycle

Fix:
- Replace all 4 batteries
- Use name brand
- Test immediately
- Should be quiet again
```
### 3. Gear Wear and Tooth Damage Acoustics

**Gear mesh mechanics**: Motor drives planetary gear reduction (typical 50:1 to 200:1 ratio) converting high-speed low-torque motor output (10,000 RPM, 0.1 Nm) to low-speed high-torque deadbolt actuation (50-200 RPM, 5-10 Nm). Plastic gears (nylon, acetal) experience wear through repeated meshing cycles: 50,000-100,000 cycles typical lifespan (3-5 years at 30 cycles/day), creating tooth profile deterioration where sharp edges round, reducing contact area increasing stress concentration causing accelerated wear cascade.

**Clicking sound generation**: Worn tooth profiles create intermittent engagement where teeth skip during high-load portions of cycle (deadbolt engaging strike resistance), producing characteristic 5-20 Hz clicking (one click per gear revolution, 50-200 RPM / 60 equals 0.8-3 Hz fundamental plus harmonics). This differs from alignment grinding (continuous broadband) through rhythmic pattern synchronized with gear rotation.

Fix:
- May need motor replacement
- Contact manufacturer
- Warranty if <2 years
- Consider new lock if old
```
### 4. Lack of Lubrication (10%)

**Increased friction:**
```
Problem:
- Moving parts dry
- Metal-on-metal
- Squealing sound
- More resistance

Fix:
- Lubricate deadbolt:
  - Graphite powder
  - In and around deadbolt
  - Work back/forth 10 times

- Lubricate motor area:
  - Dry silicone spray
  - NOT WD-40 or oil
  - Attracts dirt

- Expected improvement:
  - 50-70% quieter
  - Smoother operation
```
### 5. Overtightened Screws (3%)

**Binding mechanism:**
```
Problem:
- Mounting screws too tight
- Housing compressed
- Internal parts bind
- Grinding throughout cycle

Fix:
- Loosen both screws 1/4 turn
- Test operation
- Find "sweet spot":
  - Tight enough: Secure
  - Loose enough: No binding
```
### 6. Obstruction (2%)

**Foreign object:**
```
Problem:
- Debris inside
- Paint chips
- Broken plastic
- Blocks gears

Fix:
- Remove lock from door
- Inspect interior
- Remove any debris
- Compressed air
- Test off-door
```
## Diagnostic Process

**Step-by-step:**
```
- Step 1: Test with door open
  ├─ Quiet? → Door/strike issue
  └─ Still loud? → Internal issue

- Step 2: Check battery level
  ├─ <30%? → Replace, retest
  └─ >30%? → Continue

- Step 3: Check alignment
  ├─ Deadbolt hits strike edge?
  │   → Adjust strike
  └─ Smooth entry? → Continue

- Step 4: Lubricate
  ├─ Graphite powder
  ├─ Work mechanism
  └─ Retest

- Step 5: Loosen screws
  ├─ 1/4 turn both screws
  └─ Retest

- Still loud? → Motor/gear issue
  → Contact manufacturer
```
## When to Replace vs Repair

**Repair worth it:**
```
✓ Lock <2 years (warranty)
✓ Noise started recently
✓ Responds to fixes (alignment, battery)
✓ Otherwise works fine
✓ High-quality lock brand
```
**Replace instead:**
```
✗ Lock >4 years old
✗ Cheap off-brand
✗ Multiple issues
✗ Repair cost >$80
✗ New lock $150-200
```
**Cost comparison:**
```
Motor replacement: $40-80 + labor
New lock: $150-300 installed
DIY new lock: $100-200

Decision: If lock old or cheap,
         new lock better value
```

## Prevention

**Keep motor quiet:**
```
- Annual lubrication
  - Graphite powder
  - Prevents friction buildup

- Proper installation
  - Correct alignment from start
  - Test 50× before finalizing

- Quality batteries
  - Don't let drain <30%
  - Motor struggles equals Wear

- Gentle use
  - Don't force
  - Let motor complete
  - One command at a time

- Regular inspection
  - Monthly noise check
  - Catch problems early
  - Address before damage
```

## Temporary Workarounds

**Until repair/replacement:**
```
- Use manual operation
  - Thumb turn (quiet)
  - No motor noise

- Lock at night only
  - Daytime equals Manual
  - Nighttime equals Motor
  - Reduce motor use

- Disable auto-lock
  - Manual locking
  - Extends motor life

- Lower expectations
  - Acknowledge it's loud
  - Still functions
  - Plan replacement
```

## Summary Checklist

**Fix motor noise:**

1. ☑️ **Test with door open** (isolate cause)
2. ☑️ **Replace batteries** (if <30%)
3. ☑️ **Check strike alignment** (smooth entry?)
4. ☑️ **Lubricate mechanism** (graphite powder)
5. ☑️ **Loosen screws** (1/4 turn)
6. ☑️ **Remove obstructions** (inspect interior)

**If still loud:**
7. ☑️ **Contact manufacturer** (warranty?)
8. ☑️ **Consider replacement** (if old/cheap)

**Normal:** Quiet whir, 30-40 dB, 2-3 seconds
**Problem:** Grinding, clicking, >50 dB, struggling

**Pro tip:** Motor noise that gradually increases over months equals Normal wear, consider replacement. Motor noise that suddenly starts equals Something changed (misalignment, obstruction), fixable. Don't ignore grinding sounds - they indicate wear that will eventually cause failure. Address early while still under warranty!
