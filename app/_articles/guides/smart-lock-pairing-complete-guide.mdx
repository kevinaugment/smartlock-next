## Multi-Lock Fleet Pairing

### Best Practices for 10+ Locks

**Scenario:** Property manager deploying 50 smart locks across buildings.

**Challenges:**
- Time-consuming if done individually (50 × 15 min = 12.5 hours)
- Consistency required (all same network, settings)
- Documentation needed (which lock is which)
- Testing at scale

**Optimized workflow:**

```
Preparation Phase (2 hours):
├─ Create spreadsheet: Serial # | Location | DSK | Install Date
├─ Label each lock with location code before install
├─ Pre-configure hub with lock zones/rooms
├─ Assign static IPs if WiFi locks
└─ Prepare installation teams

Installation Phase (1 day for 50 locks):
├─ Team A: Installs locks physically (50 × 10 min = 8 hours, 2 people)
├─ Team B: Pairs locks to network (50 × 5 min = 4 hours, 1 person)
├─ Team C: Tests each lock (50 × 3 min = 2.5 hours, 1 person)
└─ Parallel execution: 8 hours total with proper staffing

Pairing Assembly Line:
├─ Station 1: Power on lock, verify battery
├─ Station 2: Start inclusion, enter DSK
├─ Station 3: Assign to location, test command
├─ Station 4: Document completion, QA check
└─ Process 6-8 locks per hour per station

Efficiency gains:
├─ Serial process: 50 × 15 min = 12.5 hours
├─ Parallel process: 50 ÷ 4 stations ÷ 5 locks/hr = 2.5 hours
└─ 5× faster with organized workflow
```

**Quality assurance:**
```
Checklist per lock:
├─ [ ] Physical installation secure
├─ [ ] Paired with S2 security (Z-Wave) or equivalent
├─ [ ] Lock/unlock test successful
├─ [ ] Battery level >90%
├─ [ ] RSSI better than -70 dBm
├─ [ ] Location labeled correctly in hub
├─ [ ] Documented in asset spreadsheet
└─ [ ] Spare physical key stored securely
```

## Performance Optimization After Pairing

### Network Health Monitoring

**Post-pairing optimization (first 48 hours):**

```
Hour 0-24: Mesh network self-optimization
├─ Devices discover optimal routes
├─ RSSI values stabilize
├─ Battery consumption normalizes
└─ Expected: Some command failures normal

Hour 24-48: Network stabilization
├─ Routes locked in
├─ Performance should be consistent
├─ If still issues → manual intervention needed
└─ Expected: >95% command success rate

Week 1-2: Baseline establishment
├─ Track average response time
├─ Monitor battery drain rate
├─ Document RSSI values
└─ Create performance baseline for future comparison
```

**Performance metrics to track:**

| Metric | Target | Warning | Critical |
|--------|--------|---------|----------|
| **Command success rate** | >95% | 90-95% | <90% |
| **Avg response time** | <2 sec | 2-5 sec | >5 sec |
| **RSSI signal strength** | >-70 dBm | -70 to -80 | <-80 dBm |
| **Battery drain** | <5%/month (mesh) | 5-10%/month | >10%/month |
| **Failed messages** | <5/day | 5-20/day | >20/day |

**When to add mesh routers:**
```
Indicators you need more routers:
├─ RSSI consistently <-75 dBm
├─ Command success <90%
├─ Frequent "device unreachable" errors
├─ Battery drains faster than expected
└─ Locks >50 feet from hub

Router placement strategy:
├─ Place halfway between hub and problem lock
├─ Use always-powered devices (smart plugs)
├─ Target: Every lock has 2+ route options
└─ Overkill is better than underkill for critical locks
```

---

### Optimizing Pairing for Battery Life

**Battery-conscious pairing strategy:**

```
Standard pairing (most people):
├─ Pair lock wherever convenient
├─ Accept whatever signal strength results
├─ Battery life: 8-12 months (Zigbee/Z-Wave)
└─ Acceptable for most use cases

Optimized pairing (power users):
├─ Measure RSSI before final lock placement
├─ Add routers BEFORE pairing if needed
├─ Pair only when RSSI >-65 dBm
├─ Battery life: 12-18 months
└─ Worth it for hard-to-access locks

Why it matters:
├─ Poor signal → lock retransmits messages
├─ Retransmits consume 2-3× power
├─ Compounds over months
└─ 50% battery life difference possible

Measurement procedure:
├─ Install lock (don't pair yet)
├─ Place phone at lock location
├─ Use WiFi analyzer app (for WiFi locks)
├─ OR: Temporarily pair basic Zigbee sensor at location
├─ Measure RSSI for 5 minutes
├─ If <-70 dBm: Add router first
└─ Then pair lock for best battery life

## Troubleshooting Decision Tree

**Systematic pairing troubleshooting:**

```
Pairing fails?
│
├─ Lock powers on?
│   ├─ NO → Replace batteries (fresh, not rechargeable)
│   └─ YES → Continue
│
├─ Hub sees lock during discovery?
│   ├─ NO → Signal/range issue
│   │   ├─ Move closer (10-15 feet)
│   │   ├─ Check interference (turn off 2.4GHz devices)
│   │   └─ Try different time of day
│   │
│   └─ YES → Continue
│
├─ Pairing starts but fails mid-process?
│   ├─ WiFi lock → Check WiFi password, 2.4GHz enabled
│   ├─ Z-Wave lock → Check DSK entry, try S2 Authenticated instead
│   ├─ Zigbee lock → Check install code, try without security
│   └─ Matter lock → Check Border Router, update platform app
│
├─ Pairing completes but lock unresponsive?
│   ├─ Check RSSI (add routers if <-70 dBm)
│   ├─ Update hub firmware
│   ├─ Factory reset lock and re-pair
│   └─ Check device handler/driver compatibility
│
└─ Pairing succeeds but no security (Z-Wave)?
    ├─ Exclude lock
    ├─ Re-include with S2 Access Control
    └─ DO NOT USE without encryption
```

## Summary: Pairing Success Checklist

**Maximize pairing success rate (95%+):**

**Before pairing:**
- [ ] Fresh batteries installed (<1 week old)
- [ ] Lock powers on and operates manually
- [ ] Hub/router within 30 feet of lock location
- [ ] Documentation ready (QR code, DSK, manual)
- [ ] App/hub firmware updated to latest
- [ ] Interference minimized (other devices off)

**During pairing:**
- [ ] Follow manufacturer procedure exactly
- [ ] Don't skip security steps (DSK, QR code)
- [ ] Allow full time for pairing (don't rush)
- [ ] Verify each step completes before proceeding
- [ ] Note any error messages for troubleshooting

**After pairing:**
- [ ] Test lock/unlock 3 times minimum
- [ ] Check RSSI signal strength (target: >-70 dBm)
- [ ] Verify security enabled (S2, encryption)
- [ ] Assign to correct room/zone in app
- [ ] Document in asset tracking system
- [ ] Monitor for 48 hours for stability

**If pairing fails:**
- [ ] Factory reset lock completely
- [ ] Remove from hub (exclude if Z-Wave)
- [ ] Wait 5 minutes before retry
- [ ] Try at different time of day
- [ ] Contact manufacturer support if 3+ failures

**Bottom line:** 90% of pairing issues are interference, low battery, or skipping steps. Systematic preparation and following exact procedures yields 95%+ first-attempt success rate. For large deployments, assembly-line workflow reduces per-lock pairing time from 15 minutes to 5 minutes while maintaining quality.
