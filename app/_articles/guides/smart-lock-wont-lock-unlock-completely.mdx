## Quick Answer: The Incomplete Motor Travel Problem

**Incomplete lock/unlock cycles occur when motor fails completing full deadbolt extension/retraction due to mechanical obstruction exceeding motor torque budget (40%), position-sensing calibration drift causing premature stop command (30%), or battery voltage insufficiency reducing available motor power below threshold required overcoming friction (20%).** These partial-travel failures manifest as deadbolt extending 80-95% of full throw (1/8-1/4 inch short of complete extension) creating vulnerable security state where door appears locked yet deadbolt engagement insufficient resisting forced entry, or incomplete retraction preventing door opening requiring manual override frustrating smart lock convenience value proposition.

The obstruction-dominance (40%) reflects motor torque limitation: residential smart lock motors generate 3-5 Nm (Newton-meters) continuous torque, 8-12 Nm peak torque, sufficient overcoming typical deadbolt friction (1-2 Nm) with 2-3× safety margin, yet strike plate misalignment adding 5-8 Nm resistance (deadbolt scraping strike edge) exceeds motor capability causing mid-cycle stall. This torque insufficiency creates characteristic 90% completion failure where motor advances deadbolt until encountering strike resistance, stalls attempting to overcome obstruction, times out after 3-5 seconds maximum-torque delivery, aborts operation reporting "jammed" status despite mechanical path theoretically clear.

## Systematic Fault Isolation: The Door-Open Diagnostic Test

Incomplete cycle troubleshooting demands distinguishing external mechanical interference (door/strike obstruction) from internal lock failure (motor, calibration, power), achieved through door-open testing eliminating door-related variables isolating lock-intrinsic issues.

### Incomplete Extension/Retraction Failure Mode Classification

| Failure Pattern | Door Open Behavior | Door Closed Behavior | Root Cause Category | Diagnostic Confidence | Primary Fix | Success Rate |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Stops at 90-95%** | Works perfectly | Fails consistently | Strike plate obstruction | 95% | Strike alignment, filing | 90%+ |
| **Stops at 80-90%** | Fails identically | Fails identically | Calibration drift | 90% | Recalibration, power cycle | 85%+ |
| **Slow then stops** | Works slowly | Struggles then stops | Low battery voltage | 95% | Battery replacement | 95%+ |
| **Random stopping** | Works sometimes | Fails sometimes | Intermittent binding | 70% | Screw loosening, lubrication | 75% |
| **Immediate stop** | Stops at start | Stops at start | Motor failure or obstruction | 85% | Inspection, warranty claim | Variable |
| **Overshoots** | Extends too far | Jams into frame | Calibration overshoot | 80% | Recalibration with limits | 80% |
| **Multiple attempts** | Retries succeed | Retries then success | Marginal power/resistance | 75% | Battery + alignment | 85% |

**The door-open test protocol**: With door fully open (eliminating strike plate contact), command lock/unlock operation observing: (1) completion success (reaches full extension/retraction), (2) operation duration (2-3 seconds normal, >5 seconds indicates power/friction issue), (3) motor sound quality (smooth whir normal, grinding indicates mechanical binding), (4) consistency (10 consecutive cycles all identical). Perfect door-open operation yet door-closed failure conclusively indicates external obstruction (strike misalignment, door warping). Identical failure door-open and door-closed indicates internal lock issue (calibration, motor, power).

## Door-Related Issues (40%)

### Symptoms:
- Works with door open
- Fails or struggles with door closed
- Grinding/clicking sound
- Sometimes works, sometimes doesn't

### Fix 1: Strike Plate Alignment

```
□ Check deadbolt entry:
  1. Manually extend deadbolt (thumb turn)
  2. Close door slowly
  3. Watch where deadbolt meets strike

□ If hitting edge of hole:
  - Mark with pencil
  - Adjust strike plate up/down/left/right
  - OR: File strike hole 1-2mm larger

□ Proper alignment:
  - Deadbolt enters smoothly
  - Zero resistance
  - No metal-on-metal contact
```

### Fix 2: Reduce Resistance

```
□ Loosen mounting screws:
  - Interior screws 1/4 turn
  - Allows micro-adjustment
  - Test if improves

□ Lubricate strike:
  - Graphite powder (not oil)
  - In strike hole
  - On deadbolt tip

□ Check door position:
  - Sagging? Tighten hinges
  - Binding? Plane door edge
  - Warped? May need replacement
```

## Lock-Related Issues (60%)

### 1. Position Encoder Calibration Drift: The Accumulated Error Problem

Smart lock position sensing implements open-loop stepper motor control (no feedback sensor verifying actual position, only commanded steps counted) or closed-loop encoder feedback (optical/magnetic sensor measuring shaft rotation), both vulnerable to calibration drift where assumed position diverges from actual position through accumulated errors.

**Stepper motor step-loss accumulation**: Commanded motor rotation ("advance 5 steps") normally produces 5 steps actual rotation, yet momentary load exceeding holding torque causes step loss (motor skips steps, rotor doesn't advance despite energized coils) where controller counts 5 steps yet shaft rotated only 3. This per-operation error accumulates: 100 operations × 0.5% average step loss = 50% accumulated error after months, explaining "worked perfectly initially, fails after 6 months" pattern where calibration drift gradually exceeds mechanical tolerance (±5-10 steps acceptable, ±100 steps creates 1/4 inch positional error causing premature stop).

**Recalibration methodology**: Force motor running to hard mechanical stops (fully retracted, fully extended positions where further rotation physically impossible creating maximum torque resistance) providing absolute position references independent of accumulated count errors, then measure total step count between stops establishing true full-travel distance. Controller stores calibrated values replacing previous drift-corrupted values. Manual recalibration (power cycle + thumb turn exercise) achieves same result: battery removal zeros step counter, manual thumb turn operations allow lock observing full mechanical range, power-on auto-calibration measures range during first motor-driven cycle.

### 2. Battery Voltage Sag and Motor Torque Degradation

DC motor torque proves directly proportional to voltage (T ∝ V at constant load), creating non-linear performance degradation as battery voltage drops: 20% voltage reduction (6.0V to 4.8V) produces not 20% torque loss but rather 35-40% reduction due to compounding effects (reduced current, increased internal resistance, magnetic saturation changes). This disproportionate torque loss explains sudden failure threshold where lock operates successfully at 50% battery (5.4V providing adequate torque margin) yet fails completely at 40% battery (5.0V dropping below minimum torque requirement).

**Voltage sag under load**: Fresh alkaline batteries provide 6.0-6.2V no-load voltage yet drop to 5.6-5.8V under motor's 1-2A peak current draw (internal resistance ~0.2-0.5Ω per battery, 4 series = 0.8-2.0Ω total, V_sag = I × R_internal = 2A × 1Ω = 2V drop), creating effective 4.0-4.2V available under load despite voltmeter showing 6V at rest. Depleted batteries (5.0V nominal) drop to 3.0-3.5V under load, frequently below controller's brownout threshold (3.5-4.0V minimum) triggering emergency shutdown mid-cycle appearing as incomplete operation. This load-dependent behavior explains "battery shows 50% yet lock fails" where resting voltage adequate yet current-draw voltage insufficient.

### 3. Overtightened Screws (5%)

**Symptoms:**
- Never worked right since install
- Motor sounds strained
- Loosening screws helps
- Works better when slightly loose

**Fix:**
```
□ Loosen mounting screws:
  1. Both interior screws
  2. Start with 1/4 turn
  3. Test operation
  4. Continue loosening until works
  5. Find "sweet spot"

□ Sweet spot:
  - Tight enough: Lock stays mounted
  - Loose enough: No binding

□ Permanent fix:
  - May need longer screws
  - OR: Thicker door than lock designed for
  - OR: Spacers behind lock
```

### 4. Motor Failure (3%)

**Symptoms:**
- Fresh batteries don't help
- Calibration doesn't help
- Works manually but not motorized
- Weak grinding sound

**Test:**
```
□ Manual test:
  - Turn thumb turn manually
  - Should be smooth
  - Full travel both directions

□ Motor test:
  - Command from app
  - Motor runs?
  - Sounds weak?
  - Stops short?

If manual smooth but motor fails:
→ Motor issue (not mechanical)
```

**Fix:**
```
□ Warranty if <2 years:
  - Contact manufacturer
  - Motor defect
  - Replacement likely

□ Out of warranty:
  - Motor replacement ($40-80)
  - OR: New lock ($150-300)
  - Consider lock age vs cost
```

### 5. Obstruction/Debris (2%)

**Symptoms:**
- Sudden failure
- Works part way, stops
- Something feels stuck
- Recent change  - new paint, cleaning

**Fix:**
```
□ Inspect mechanism:
  - Remove lock from door
  - Look for debris
  - Paint overspray?
  - Dirt/dust buildup?

□ Clean thoroughly:
  - Compressed air
  - Dry cloth
  - Graphite powder for lube
  - NO oil/WD-40

□ Test off door:
  - Before reinstalling
  - Should operate smoothly
  - Full travel both directions
```

## Summary: Torque Budget Restoration Through Systematic Resistance Elimination

Incomplete cycle resolution demands restoring favorable torque balance where motor's available torque (3-5 Nm continuous, 8-12 Nm peak) exceeds total resistance (deadbolt friction 1-2 Nm + strike interaction 0-8 Nm + internal binding 0-3 Nm), recognizing motor operates near torque ceiling where minor resistance increases (misaligned strike adding 3-5 Nm, low battery reducing available torque 20-40%, internal binding from overtight screws adding 2-4 Nm) push total demand beyond motor capability causing mid-cycle stall. Systematic optimization eliminates highest-resistance contributors first: strike alignment (potentially eliminating 5-8 Nm obstruction resistance), battery replacement (restoring 20-40% lost motor power), screw loosening (eliminating 2-4 Nm binding), calibration correction (preventing premature stop before mechanical limits reached).

**Calibration drift technical explanation**: Motor position sensing implements step counting (stepper motor: 60-200 steps per revolution, 3-5 revolutions full deadbolt travel = 180-1000 counted steps) where controller tracks "locked" position (step 0) and "unlocked" position (step 200) commanding motor run until target step reached. Calibration drift occurs when step counter diverges from actual position: obstruction causing motor skip steps (commanded 5 steps yet shaft rotated only 3 due to momentary stall), manual override rotating shaft without step counting (thumb turn moves deadbolt yet controller unaware), or encoder wear creating miscounts. This accumulated error manifests as controller believing deadbolt fully extended (step count = 200) yet actual position only 90% (180 steps), commanding premature stop. Recalibration resets zero reference by driving motor to hard mechanical stops (fully retracted, fully extended) relearning actual step counts eliminating accumulated error.

**The 95%-completion symptom diagnostic significance**: Failure at 90-95% completion (deadbolt visibly extended yet final 1/8-1/4 inch unachieved) almost exclusively indicates external obstruction (strike contact) rather than internal failure, as internal issues (motor, calibration, battery) manifest randomly across travel range not consistently at endpoint. This endpoint-specific failure reflects geometric reality: only at full extension does deadbolt contact strike plate, earlier in travel deadbolt travels through air resistance-free. Conversely, mid-cycle failure (stopping at 40-60% travel) indicates internal issue (calibration commanding premature stop, battery voltage dropping below minimum, motor mechanical failure) as strike contact impossible mid-travel.
