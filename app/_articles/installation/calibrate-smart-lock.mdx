## Quick Answer: Position Reference Re-establishment Protocol

**Lock calibration resets position encoder reference points teaching motor controller absolute locked/unlocked positions through physical hard-stop detection, correcting accumulated step-counting errors (stepper motor step loss 0.1-0.5% per operation accumulating to 10-50% drift over 100-1000 cycles) causing premature stop commands (controller believes full extension achieved at 90% actual travel) or status misreporting (position counter indicates locked yet deadbolt 1/4-inch short).** Calibration methods: app-initiated automated sequence (premium locks, 1-2 minute motor-driven endpoint detection), power-cycle manual training (universal method, 3-5 manual cycles teaching mechanical limits), keypad programming menu (select models, on-device calibration). Success rate 75-85% resolving position drift issues.

### Calibration Method Comparison Matrix

| Method | Availability | Complexity | Duration | Success Rate | Requires Hub | Position Accuracy | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|-----------|----------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **App-Initiated Auto** | Premium locks  - 70% | Easy  - 3 taps | 1-2 min | 85-90% | Yes  - paired | Highest  - ±1-2° | First choice if available |
| **Power Cycle Manual** | Universal  - 99% | Moderate  - manual operation | 3-5 min | 75-80% | No | High  - ±3-5° | No app available, universal method |
| **Keypad Programming** | Select models  - 30% | Complex  - menu navigation | 2-3 min | 80-85% | No | High  - ±2-3° | Standalone operation needed |
| **Factory Reset** | Universal  - 100% | Complex  - reconfiguration | 15-30 min | 95%+ | Varies | Highest  - fresh calibration | Last resort, requires full setup |

## Position Encoder Drift Mechanics and Calibration Necessity

**Stepper motor open-loop control limitations**: Smart locks predominantly implement open-loop stepper motor control (no feedback sensor verifying actual shaft position, only commanded steps counted) where controller tracks position through step accumulation: "locked" position = step 0, "unlocked" = step 200, current position = cumulative steps from reference. This open-loop architecture proves cost-effective ($2-5 per lock versus $15-25 for closed-loop encoder) yet vulnerable to step loss where commanded rotation fails achieving expected movement.

**Step loss accumulation mechanism**: Momentary load exceeding motor holding torque (typical 0.3-0.8 Nm, versus required 0.2-0.5 Nm nominal yet encountering 1-2 Nm peak during strike contact) causes rotor skip where energized coils fail advancing shaft despite step counter incrementing. Example: motor commanded "advance 5 steps" (controller increments position counter +5) yet shaft actually rotates 4 steps (strike resistance causing 1-step skip), creating +1 step cumulative error. After 100 operations with 0.5% average step loss = 50 steps accumulated error (200 steps full range × 25% = 50 steps = 1/4-inch position error on typical 1-inch deadbolt travel).

### Symptoms Requiring Calibration

```
Common signs:
☑ Incomplete lock/unlock (stops at 80-95%)
☑ Status wrong (shows locked but isn't)
☑ Increased failures (commands timeout)
☑ Inconsistent operation (works sometimes)
☑ After battery replacement (voltage change)
☑ Seasonal issues (temperature affects friction)
```

## Calibration Methods

### Method 1: Via App (Preferred)

**Most locks support app calibration:**

```
□ Open smart lock app
□ Select your lock
□ Navigate to Settings
  - Look for: "Calibrate", "Auto-Calibrate", 
    "Reset Position", "Learn Position"

□ Tap Calibration option

□ Follow prompts:
  - Lock will extend to physical stop
  - Lock will retract to physical stop
  - May repeat 2-3 times
  - Takes 1-2 minutes

□ Completion:
  - App shows "Calibration Complete"
  - Status updates
  - Test lock/unlock

□ Verify:
  - Lock/unlock 5 times
  - Should complete fully each time
  - Status updates correctly
```

**Brands with app calibration:**
- Schlage Encode: Settings → Calibrate
- Yale Assure: Settings → Auto-Calibrate
- August: Automatic after battery change
- Kwikset: Settings → Reset Position

### Method 2: Power Cycle (Universal)

**Works for most locks:**

```
□ Remove ALL batteries
  - Take out all 4 batteries
  - Wait 30 seconds minimum

□ Manually operate lock:
  1. Extend deadbolt fully (thumb turn)
  2. Retract fully
  3. Repeat 2-3 times
  - Teaches lock physical limits

□ Reinsert batteries:
  - Ensure correct +/- orientation
  - Insert all 4 batteries

□ Wait 2 minutes:
  - Lock boots up
  - Auto-calibrates on first operation

□ Test immediately:
  - Lock/unlock via app or keypad
  - Should complete fully
  - Repeat 3-5 times
```

**Success rate:** 70-80%

### Method 3: Keypad Calibration (Some Models)

**Direct at lock:**

```
□ Enter programming mode:
  - Usually: Master code + special button
  - Varies by brand (check manual)

□ Navigate to calibration menu:
  - Look for "CAL" or "Calibrate"
  - Follow screen prompts

□ Lock self-calibrates:
  - Extends/retracts multiple times
  - Learns physical stops
  - Beeps when complete

□ Exit programming mode

□ Test operation
```

**Less common** - Check if your lock supports

## Troubleshooting Failed Calibration

### Calibration Fails to Complete

**Causes:**
```
□ Battery too low (<40%)
  → Replace batteries first

□ Mechanical obstruction
  → Check strike plate alignment
  → Remove lock, test off door

□ Door/frame misalignment
  → Adjust strike plate
  → Test with door open first

□ Motor issue
  → May need replacement
  → Contact manufacturer
```

### Calibration Completes But Issue Persists

**Solutions:**
```
□ Recalibrate 2-3 times
  - First calibration may not be perfect
  - Repeat process

□ Factory reset then calibrate
  - Full reset to defaults
  - Then calibrate fresh

□ Check for interference
  - Strike plate too tight?
  - Weather stripping too thick?
  - Adjust clearances
```

## Maintenance Schedule

### Regular Calibration

```
☑ After battery replacement (always)
☑ Every 6 months (routine maintenance)
☑ After firmware update (if issues)
☑ Seasonal (fall and spring)
☑ After any adjustment (strike plate, hinges)
```

### Preventive Calibration

**Before problems occur:**
```
Set calendar reminder:
- "Calibrate Smart Lock" every 6 months
- Takes 5 minutes
- Prevents drift accumulation
- Maintains optimal performance
```

## When Calibration Won't Help

**Other issues requiring different fixes:**
```
✗ Physical damage (broken motor)
✗ Severe misalignment (door warped)
✗ Electronic failure (circuit board)
✗ Low battery (calibrate after replacing)
✗ Connectivity issues (not calibration)
```

**These need:**
- Professional repair
- Replacement parts
- Door adjustment
- Manufacturer support

## Advanced: Force Calibration

**For stubborn issues:**

```
□ Full factory reset:
  1. Reset lock to defaults
  2. Re-pair as new device
  3. Power cycle
  4. Manually operate 5 times
  5. Calibrate via app
  6. Test extensively

□ Off-door calibration:
  1. Remove lock from door
  2. Power cycle
  3. Let calibrate freely (no resistance)
  4. Reinstall on door
  5. Test

□ Temperature calibration:
  - Calibrate in same conditions you use
  - Cold weather: Calibrate when cold
  - Hot weather: Calibrate when hot
```
