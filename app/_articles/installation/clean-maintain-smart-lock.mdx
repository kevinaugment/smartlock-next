## Quick Answer

**Monthly maintenance: Wipe keypad with damp cloth (no chemicals), check battery level (replace at 30%), test all codes work, verify smooth operation. Annual: Lubricate with graphite powder (NOT WD-40), check mounting screws, inspect for corrosion, update firmware.** Total time: 5 minutes monthly, 20 minutes annually.

**Maintenance frequency:**
- Monthly: Quick clean + function test  - 5 min
- Quarterly: Deep clean + alignment check  - 15 min
- Annually: Lubrication + full inspection  - 30 min

## Monthly Maintenance (5 Minutes)

### Quick Checklist

```
☑️ Clean keypad exterior
☑️ Check battery level
☑️ Test one code
☑️ Verify smooth operation
☑️ Check for loose screws
```

### Step 1: Clean Keypad/Exterior

```
What you need:
- Soft microfiber cloth
- Water  - slightly damp, not dripping
- Optional: Isopropyl alcohol 70%  - for stubborn grime

Process:
□ Dampen cloth slightly (wring out well)
□ Wipe keypad gently
  - Remove fingerprints, dirt, oils
  - Pay attention to number buttons
  - Don't press buttons while cleaning

□ Wipe handle and exterior surfaces

□ Dry with clean dry cloth

DON'T use:
❌ Harsh chemicals (bleach, ammonia)
❌ Abrasive cleaners (scouring powder)
❌ Excessive water (dripping wet)
❌ Spray cleaners directly on lock
```

**Why it matters:**
- Dirty keypad = Harder to press buttons
- Oils from fingers = Corrosion over time
- Clean lock = Looks better, lasts longer

### Step 2: Check Battery Level

```
□ Open app → Lock → Battery status
□ Note level: _____%

Action based on level:
- 70-100%: OK, check next month
- 40-69%: Note for replacement soon
- 30-39%: Buy batteries, plan replacement
- <30%: Replace immediately

□ Document date checked
```

### Step 3: Test Function

```
□ Test lock/unlock via app (1×)
  - Should respond <2 seconds
  - Smooth operation
  - No grinding

□ Test one PIN code
  - Should unlock first try
  - No error beeps

□ Manual operation (thumb turn)
  - Smooth, no resistance
```

### Step 4: Visual Inspection

```
□ Check exterior mounting screws
  - Finger-tight? (don't need tool)
  - If loose: Tighten 1/4 turn

□ Look for corrosion
  - Especially around battery compartment
  - Green/white powder = Corrosion
  - If found: Clean immediately (see below)

□ Check strike plate
  - Screws tight?
  - Hole clear of debris?
```

**Time:** 5 minutes total

## Quarterly Maintenance (15 Minutes)

### Every 3 Months

```
☑️ All monthly tasks (above)
☑️ Deep clean keypad
☑️ Test all user codes
☑️ Check alignment
☑️ Review access logs
☑️ Remove unused codes
```

### Deep Keypad Cleaning

```
What you need:
- Cotton swabs  - Q-tips
- Isopropyl alcohol 70%
- Soft brush  - old toothbrush

Process:
□ Dip cotton swab in alcohol
□ Clean around each button
  - Remove dirt from crevices
  - Don't soak (just damp)

□ Brush gently around buttons
  - Remove accumulated gunk

□ Wipe with dry cloth

□ Let air dry 5 minutes
```

### Test All Codes

```
□ List all active user codes
□ Test each code works
□ Delete codes that:
  - Belong to people who left
  - Haven't been used in 90+ days
  - Are temporary but expired

□ Document: ___ codes tested, ___ deleted
```

### Alignment Check

```
□ With door open:
  - Extend deadbolt manually
  - Close door slowly
  - Watch deadbolt enter strike
  
□ Should be smooth (no grinding)

□ If misaligned:
  - Adjust strike plate
  - See: [Calibration Guide](/support/calibrate-smart-lock)
```

**Time:** 15 minutes total

## Annual Maintenance (30 Minutes)

### Once Per Year

```
☑️ All quarterly tasks
☑️ Lubricate mechanism
☑️ Full function test (50 cycles)
☑️ Check for wear
☑️ Update firmware
☑️ Replace weatherstripping (if outdoor)
☑️ Document maintenance
```

### Lubrication (Critical)

```
What you need:
- Graphite powder OR PTFE dry lubricant
- NOT: WD-40, oil, grease  - attracts dirt

Process:
□ Remove lock from door (if possible)
  - Easier to access mechanism

□ Apply graphite:
  1. Puff graphite powder into keyway
  2. Puff into deadbolt mechanism
  3. Small amount (don't overdo)

□ Work mechanism:
  - Extend/retract deadbolt 20 times
  - Turn thumb turn multiple times
  - Distributes lubricant

□ Wipe excess:
  - Remove graphite that came out
  - Don't leave on exterior

□ Reinstall lock (if removed)

□ Test operation:
  - Should be noticeably smoother
```

**Why graphite not oil:**
- Oil attracts dust/dirt
- Gums up in cold weather
- Can damage electronics
- Graphite = Dry, doesn't attract debris

### Full Function Test

```
□ Perform 50 lock/unlock cycles:
  - 10× via app
  - 10× via keypad
  - 10× manual thumb turn
  - 10× with door closed
  - 10× with door open

□ Track issues:
  - Jams: ___
  - Timeouts: ___
  - Errors: ___

□ Goal: 0 issues in 50 attempts

□ If >2 issues:
  - Troubleshoot before considering done
  - May need adjustment or repair
```

### Wear Inspection

```
□ Check deadbolt:
  - Signs of wear? (scratches, rough edge)
  - Still smooth?

□ Check strike plate:
  - Wearing through? (metal showing)
  - Hole enlarging?

□ Check keypad buttons:
  - All respond to press?
  - None stuck or mushy?

□ Check battery contacts:
  - Clean? (no corrosion)
  - Springs intact?

□ Document findings
```

### Firmware Update

```
□ Check for lock firmware update
  - App → Settings → About → Check for update

□ Check for hub firmware update
  - Hub → System → Software update

□ Apply updates if available
  - See: [Firmware Update Guide](/support/update-smart-lock-firmware)

□ Test after update
```

**Time:** 30 minutes total

## Outdoor Lock Extra Care

**For locks exposed to weather:**

### Monthly (in addition to standard)

```
☑️ Check weatherstripping
  - Seals tight? Replace if worn

☑️ Look for water intrusion
  - Moisture in battery compartment?
  - If wet: Dry thoroughly, check seal

☑️ Check for rust/corrosion
  - More common in coastal/humid areas
  - Clean immediately if found
```

### Quarterly

```
☑️ Apply silicone sealant
  - Around exterior trim (if gaps)
  - Prevents water entry

☑️ Check mounting
  - Weather can loosen screws
  - Retighten if needed
```

### Use lithium batteries

```
✓ Better in extreme temperatures
✓ Last longer in cold
✓ More reliable in heat
```

## Corrosion Treatment

**If you find battery corrosion:**

```
What you need:
- White vinegar OR lemon juice
- Baking soda
- Old toothbrush
- Cotton swabs
- Isopropyl alcohol

Process:
□ Remove batteries immediately
  - Don't let corrosion spread

□ Clean battery contacts:
  1. Dip cotton swab in vinegar
  2. Scrub corroded areas
  3. Neutralize with baking soda paste
  4. Scrub again
  5. Wipe with alcohol
  6. Let dry completely

□ Check batteries:
  - If leaked: Dispose properly
  - Never reuse corroded batteries

□ Test contacts:
  - Should be shiny metal (not green/white)

□ Insert fresh batteries

□ Monitor next few days
  - If corrosion returns: Contact manufacturer
```
