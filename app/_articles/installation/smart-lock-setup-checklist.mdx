## Quick Answer: Systematic Commissioning Protocol

**Smart lock commissioning implements staged validation where each configuration layer verified before proceeding: mechanical installation (manual operation 10-cycle test confirming alignment), electronic pairing (bidirectional communication verification), user provisioning (code/biometric enrollment with test authentication), automation configuration (auto-lock/scheduling with multi-cycle validation), firmware updating (ensuring latest security patches), backup verification (physical key + emergency access confirmation).** This systematic approach prevents cascading failures where downstream configuration assumes upstream functionality yet unverified baseline creates unreliable operation requiring repeated troubleshooting versus single comprehensive validation session (45-60 minutes) establishing confident baseline.

### Setup Stage Validation Matrix

| Stage | Duration | Prerequisites | Success Criteria | Test Protocol | Failure Recovery | Skip Risk |
|-------|----------|--------------|------------------|---------------|------------------|----------|
| **Mechanical Install** | 15-20 min | Door measurement, tools | 10/10 smooth manual cycles | Thumb turn + key test, door open/closed | Strike adjustment, realignment | Lock jams, motor strain |
| **Power & Pairing** | 5-10 min | Fresh batteries, hub ready | App shows "Connected", LED responds | Send lock/unlock command | Battery reseat, re-pair, factory reset | No electronic control |
| **User Provisioning** | 10-15 min | Pairing complete | All codes/fingerprints work 5/5 | Test each method door-closed | Re-enroll, check collision | Lockout risk |
| **Access Testing** | 10-15 min | Users added | All methods work, status accurate | 10 cycles per method, verify app status | Troubleshoot specific method | Unreliable operation |
| **Automation Config** | 5-10 min | Access verified | Auto-lock triggers correctly | Wait timeout, verify locks automatically | Adjust timing, check sensor | Security gap |
| **Firmware Update** | 5-10 min | Internet connection | Firmware current, no issues post-update | Check version, test all functions | Rollback if supported | Security vulnerabilities |
| **Documentation** | 5 min | Setup complete | Codes recorded securely, manual saved | Verify can retrieve codes | Create backup record | Lost access |

  - Note settings
  - Record codes (securely)
  - Reference for future

☑ Clean up:
  - Remove packaging
  - Store manual
  - Keep warranty info
  - Dispose of old lock
```

## Common Setup Mistakes

**Avoid these:**
```
❌ Skipping mechanical testing
  → Alignment problems later

❌ Using old batteries
  → Fails quickly, frustrating

❌ Not testing before relying on
  → Locked out when doesn't work

❌ Weak codes (1234)
  → Security risk

❌ No backup access
  → Disaster when fails

❌ Overtightening screws
  → Binding, grinding

❌ Rushing setup
  → Miss critical steps
```

## Post-Setup Monitoring

**First week:**
```
☑ Daily testing:
  - Use different access methods
  - Verify reliability
  - Note any issues

☑ Battery check:
  - Should stay near 100%
  - If drains fast, investigate

☑ Connectivity check:
  - Always online?
  - Any disconnections?
  - Add repeater if needed

☑ User feedback:
  - Family members able to use?
  - Any confusion?
  - Additional training needed?
```

## When to Call for Help

**Contact support if:**
```
□ Can't complete pairing after 3 tries
□ Lock binds or jams repeatedly

## Summary Checklist

**Complete setup:**

**Phase 1 - Physical (20 min):**
1. ☑️ Install deadbolt & strike
2. ☑️ Mount lock
3. ☑️ Test mechanical operation

**Phase 2 - Pairing (10 min):**
4. ☑️ Insert batteries
5. ☑️ Pair with hub/app
6. ☑️ Test app control

**Phase 3 - Users (15 min):**
7. ☑️ Set master code
8. ☑️ Add user codes
9. ☑️ Test all codes

**Phase 4 - Features (10 min):**
10. ☑️ Configure auto-lock
11. ☑️ Set notifications
12. ☑️ Add voice control

**Phase 5 - Testing (10 min):**
13. ☑️ Test all access methods 10×
14. ☑️ Verify auto-lock works
15. ☑️ Stress test 20 cycles

**Total time:** 45-60 minutes

**Pro tip:** Invest the full hour in proper setup. The temptation is to "quickly install and use it" but skipping testing leads to problems. Test EVERYTHING 10× BEFORE you leave house and lock door. Finding out keypad doesn't work reliably when you're locked out at midnight = Bad time to discover. Hour of thorough testing prevents hours of frustration!
