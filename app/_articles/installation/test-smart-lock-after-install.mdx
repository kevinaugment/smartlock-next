## Quick Answer

**Test smart lock after installation: Basic test (5 min) - lock/unlock 5× manually + app + keypad. Full test (20 min) - 50 operations all methods, alignment check, auto-lock verify, battery/signal status. Don't consider install complete until all tests pass.** Only use lock daily after 24-hour burn-in with no issues.

**Minimum testing:** 50 operations (lock/unlock cycles) before trusting lock

## Why Testing Matters

### Consequences of Inadequate Testing

```
Installed but not tested:
❌ Discover jam when guests arrive (emergency)
❌ Find misalignment after door already painted
❌ Code doesn't work when you need it
❌ Auto-lock fails, left unlocked overnight
❌ Battery drains fast due to poor signal

Properly tested:
✅ Issues caught immediately (easy to fix)
✅ Confidence in reliability
✅ No surprises during daily use
✅ Optimization opportunities identified
```

**Rule:** If you're not willing to test, you're not done installing

## Quick Test (5 Minutes)

**Minimum viable test:**

```
☑️ Test 1: Manual operation (door open)
   - Turn thumb turn → Extends smoothly
   - Turn opposite → Retracts smoothly
   - No grinding or resistance

☑️ Test 2: Manual operation (door closed)
   - Lock manually → Deadbolt enters strike smoothly
   - Unlock manually → Deadbolt retracts cleanly
   - Repeat 3 times

☑️ Test 3: App control
   - Lock via app → Works within 2 seconds
   - Unlock via app → Works within 2 seconds
   - Status updates immediately

☑️ Test 4: Keypad (if equipped)
   - Enter PIN → Unlocks
   - Repeat with 2 different codes
   - No error beeps

☑️ Test 5: Battery and signal check
   - Battery shows 100% (new batteries)
   - Signal strength good (RSSI > -75)
   - Lock shows "Online"
```

**Pass all 5? Proceed to full test**

## Full Test (20-30 Minutes)

### Test 1: Alignment Verification (Critical)

```
Purpose: Ensure deadbolt aligned with strike plate

□ Open door
□ Extend deadbolt manually
□ Close door SLOWLY while watching
□ Deadbolt should:
  ✅ Enter strike hole smoothly
  ✅ Not hit metal edge
  ✅ No grinding or scraping

□ If misaligned:
  - Stop immediately
  - Adjust strike plate
  - Re-test until perfect

□ Mark as PASS only if:
  - Zero resistance
  - Zero sound (except soft click at end)
  - Works from multiple door positions (push/pull slightly)
```

### Test 2: Stress Test (50 Cycles)

```
Purpose: Verify mechanical reliability

Perform 50 lock/unlock cycles:
□ 10× via app
□ 10× via keypad (different codes)
□ 10× manual thumb turn
□ 10× with door closed
□ 10× with door open

Track failures:
- How many times it jammed? ___
- How many timeouts? ___
- How many error beeps? ___

Goal: 0 failures in 50 attempts (100% success rate)

Acceptable: 1-2 failures (98%+ rate)
Fail: 3+ failures (needs troubleshooting)
```

### Test 3: All Access Methods

```
☑️ App unlock
   - iOS app (if applicable)
   - Android app (if applicable)
   - Web dashboard (if available)

☑️ Voice control (if integrated)
   - "Alexa, unlock front door"
   - "Hey Google, unlock front door"
   - "Hey Siri, unlock front door"
   - Should require authentication

☑️ Keypad codes
   - Master code
   - User code 1
   - User code 2
   - Temporary code (if set)

☑️ Physical key (if equipped)
   - Insert and turn
   - Should override electronics

☑️ Auto-lock (if enabled)
   - Lock door manually
   - Wait auto-lock timeout (30 sec, 5 min, etc.)
   - Verify lock engages automatically

☑️ Auto-unlock (if enabled)
   - Walk away 300m
   - Return to door
   - Should unlock automatically
```

### Test 4: Edge Cases

```
☑️ Rapid operations
   - Lock → Immediately unlock → Lock
   - Should handle rapid commands
   - No timeout or confusion

☑️ Interrupted operation
   - Start lock command
   - Manually turn thumb turn mid-operation
   - Lock should complete or gracefully fail

☑️ Wrong code handling
   - Enter incorrect PIN 3 times
   - Verify lockout behavior (if applicable)
   - Verify error beeps/messages

☑️ Low battery simulation
   - Remove 1 battery (lock should warn)
   - Replace battery
   - Verify low battery alert works
```

### Test 5: Network Stability

```
☑️ Response time
   - Measure 10 app commands
   - Average should be <1 second (local)
   - <3 seconds (WiFi cloud)

☑️ Command success rate
   - All 10 commands should succeed
   - No timeouts
   - No "No Response" errors

☑️ Status updates
   - Lock manually
   - Check app updates within 5 seconds
   - Should show "Locked" accurately

☑️ Offline recovery
   - Unplug hub (Zigbee/Z-Wave)
   - Wait 2 minutes
   - Replug hub
   - Lock should reconnect within 5 minutes
```

### Test 6: Safety Features

```
☑️ Tamper detection (if equipped)
   - Try to remove lock forcefully
   - Should trigger alarm/notification

☑️ Deadbolt monitoring
   - Lock door electronically
   - Manually turn deadbolt from inside
   - App should show "Unlocked" (senses manual override)

☑️ Door ajar sensor (if equipped)
   - Lock while door open
   - Should warn "Door open" (if supported)

☑️ Auto-relock after unlock
   - Unlock door
   - Don't open door
   - Should re-lock after timeout (if enabled)
```

## 24-Hour Burn-In Test

**After passing all tests above:**

```
Day 1 (after installation):
□ Perform full test
□ Use lock normally
□ Monitor for any issues

Day 2 (24 hours later):
□ Check battery level (should be 100% or 95-99%)
□ Check lock still online
□ Verify no unexpected behavior
□ Test 10 more operations

Pass criteria:
✅ No jams in 24 hours
✅ No offline events
✅ Battery level stable
✅ All operations smooth

Fail criteria:
❌ Any jam
❌ Went offline even once
❌ Battery dropped >5%
❌ Any unexpected behavior

If fail: Troubleshoot before daily use
```

## Common Test Failures & Fixes

### Failure: Jams on Close (>2/50 tests)

**Fix:**
```
□ Adjust strike plate alignment
□ Enlarge strike hole 1-2mm
□ Loosen mounting screws 1/4 turn
□ Re-test until 0 jams in 50 attempts
```

### Failure: Slow Response (>3 seconds)

**Fix:**
```
□ Add repeater between hub and lock
□ Check signal strength (RSSI)
□ Change Zigbee channel (if interference)
□ Update hub firmware
```

### Failure: Battery Drops >5% in 24 Hours

**Fix:**
```
□ Check signal strength (weak signal drains battery)
□ Add repeater
□ Disable unnecessary features
□ Verify not over-polling (reduce to 5 min)
```

### Failure: Intermittent Offline

**Fix:**
```
□ Strengthen signal (add repeater)
□ Update firmware (hub + lock)
□ Check for interference (WiFi overlap)
□ Verify batteries seated properly
```

## When to Retest

**Retest after:**
```
☑️ Any adjustment to lock mounting
☑️ Any adjustment to strike plate

☑️ Any period of unusual behavior
```

**Annual retest:**
```
Once per year, full test again:
- Ensures long-term reliability

## Summary Checklist

**Test smart lock after installation:**

**Quick Test (5 min):**
1. ☑️ Manual lock/unlock 5×
2. ☑️ App control 2×
3. ☑️ Keypad unlock 2×
4. ☑️ Battery + signal check

**Full Test (20 min):**
5. ☑️ Alignment verification (door open + closed)
6. ☑️ 50-cycle stress test (0-2 failures acceptable)
7. ☑️ All access methods tested
8. ☑️ Edge cases verified
9. ☑️ Network stability confirmed

**24-Hour Burn-In:**
10. ☑️ No issues in first 24 hours
11. ☑️ Battery level stable

**Don't skip testing! 30 minutes of testing saves hours of troubleshooting later.**

**Pro tip:** Video record your testing session. If issues arise later, you have documented proof of how it worked initially. This helps diagnose: "Did something change in environment/setup?" vs "Was it always like this?" Plus, manufacturer support often asks for videos of the problem - you'll have a baseline to compare against.
