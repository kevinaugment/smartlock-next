## Quick Answer

**To update firmware: Ensure battery >50% + lock online → Open app → Settings → Firmware/Software Update → Download → Install (10-30 min) → Lock restarts automatically → Test lock/unlock 5× to verify.** Never interrupt update (can brick lock). Always test thoroughly after update before considering complete.

**Update time:** 10-30 minutes (download + install + restart)

## Why Firmware Updates Matter

### Benefits of Updating

```

```

### Risks of NOT Updating

```
⚠️ Security vulnerabilities remain unpatched
⚠️ Known bugs persist
⚠️ Missing new features/compatibility
⚠️ May lose support from manufacturer
⚠️ Integration issues with updated hubs
```

**Recommendation:** Update within 30 days of release (after early adopters test)

## Before You Update

### Pre-Update Checklist

```
☑️ Battery level >50% (preferably >70%)
   - Low battery = Update may fail mid-way
   - Replace batteries if <50%

☑️ Lock is online and responding
   - Test lock/unlock from app
   - Should respond within 1-2 seconds

☑️ Hub/gateway firmware updated first
   - Update hub before lock
   - Ensures compatibility

☑️ Internet connection stable
   - WiFi or cellular strong signal
   - Don't start during storm/outage

☑️ Time available (30-45 minutes)
   - Don't start if you need to leave soon
   - Update can't be interrupted

☑️ Backup key accessible
   - In case update fails
   - Can still enter with physical key

☑️ Note current firmware version
   - Settings → About → Firmware Version
   - Document before updating (rollback reference)
```

### Read Release Notes

```
□ Check what's new
   - Bug fixes (do you have these bugs?)
   - New features (do you need them?)
   - Known issues (are they blockers?)

□ Check user reports
   - Search "[Lock Model] firmware [Version] issues"
   - Reddit, manufacturer forums
   - Wait if many complaints

□ Decide if update worth risk
   - Major security fix? → Update ASAP
   - Minor feature? → Can wait
   - Lots of bugs reported? → Wait for patch
```

## Update Process

### Step 1: Prepare Lock

```
□ Ensure battery >50%
   - Check app dashboard
   - Replace if needed

□ Verify lock online
   - Status shows "Connected" or "Online"

□ Disable auto-lock temporarily (optional)
   - Prevents lock from locking during update
   - Re-enable after update

□ Inform household
   - "Lock updating for 30 min, don't try to use"
   - Prevents confusion
```

### Step 2: Start Update

```
□ Open smart lock app
□ Navigate to lock settings
   - Usually: Lock → Settings → About/Firmware
   - OR: Settings → System → Software Update

□ Check for updates
   - App queries manufacturer server
   - Shows if update available

□ Read update details
   - Version number
   - Size (MB)
   - What's included

□ Tap "Download" or "Update"
   - Some apps: Separate Download + Install
   - Others: Single "Update" button

□ Confirm update
   - App warns "Don't interrupt"
   - Confirm you want to proceed
```

### Step 3: Download Phase

```
□ App downloads firmware
   - Shows progress bar
   - Time: 2-10 minutes (depends on size + speed)

□ DON'T close app
   - Keep app open and active
   - Don't let phone sleep

□ DON'T lock phone
   - Some apps pause if phone locked

□ Stay near lock
   - WiFi locks: Stay near router
   - Zigbee/Z-Wave: Stay near hub
```

### Step 4: Installation Phase

```
□ Firmware transfers to lock
   - From hub/phone to lock
   - Progress shown in app
   - Time: 5-15 minutes

□ Lock may:
   - Beep occasionally
   - Flash LEDs
   - Display "Updating" on screen (if equipped)
   - Be unresponsive to keypad

□ CRITICAL: Do NOT:
   ❌ Turn off lock (remove batteries)
   ❌ Close app
   ❌ Remove lock from door
   ❌ Try to use lock
   ❌ Restart hub

□ If progress stalls:
   - Wait 10 minutes before worrying
   - Check lock still has power (LED active)
   - Check hub/phone still connected
```

### Step 5: Reboot Phase

```
□ Lock reboots automatically
   - May take 2-5 minutes
   - LEDs cycle, beeps, etc.

□ Lock reconnects to network
   - Auto-connects to hub/WiFi
   - Shows "Online" in app

□ App confirms success
   - "Update successful" or similar
   - New firmware version displayed
```

### Step 6: Verification

```
□ Test basic operations:
   ☑ Lock via app (should work immediately)
   ☑ Unlock via app
   ☑ Lock via keypad PIN
   ☑ Unlock via keypad PIN
   ☑ Manual lock (thumb turn)
   ☑ Manual unlock (key if equipped)

□ Check settings preserved:
   ☑ User codes still present
   ☑ Auto-lock setting same
   ☑ Notifications still enabled
   ☑ Integrations still working (Alexa, Google)

□ Test automation:
   ☑ Auto-lock works
   ☑ Auto-unlock works (if enabled)
   ☑ Voice commands (if applicable)

□ Verify new firmware version:
   ☑ Settings → About → Firmware
   ☑ Should show new version number

□ Monitor for 24 hours:
   ☑ No unexpected behavior
   ☑ Response time normal
   ☑ Battery drain normal
```

## Summary Checklist

**Update smart lock firmware:**

1. ☑️ **Battery >50%** (replace if needed)
2. ☑️ **Lock online** (test in app)
3. ☑️ **Read release notes** (know what's changing)
4. ☑️ **Start update in app** (Settings → Firmware)
5. ☑️ **Don't interrupt** (10-30 minutes)
6. ☑️ **Let lock reboot** (2-5 minutes)
7. ☑️ **Test all features** (codes, app, automation)
8. ☑️ **Monitor 24 hours** (catch issues early)

**Time: 30-45 minutes total (mostly waiting)**

**Pro tip:** Schedule firmware updates like you schedule oil changes - proactively, on a regular cadence, during low-impact times. Set a recurring calendar reminder every 3 months to check for updates. Update on a Sunday morning when you're home and have time to troubleshoot if needed. Never update right before guests arrive or you leave for vacation!
