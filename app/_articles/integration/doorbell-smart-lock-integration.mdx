Requires both devices on same platform (HomeKit, Google, Alexa, SmartThings).

## Summary Checklist

**Integrate doorbell + lock:**

1. ☑️ **Check compatibility** (same platform?)
2. ☑️ **Add both devices** (to platform app)
3. ☑️ **Create automation** (doorbell → unlock option)
4. ☑️ **Set security** (require authentication)
5. ☑️ **Test integration** (ring doorbell, try unlock)
6. ☑️ **Set restrictions** (time limits, person detection)
7. ☑️ **Have backup** (physical key, PIN)

**Best combo:** Same brand (Ring+Ring, Nest+Nest, Arlo+Arlo)

**Pro tip:** Don't over-automate unlock. It's tempting to set up "face detected → auto-unlock" for everyone you know, but this is security risk. Keep auto-unlock for ONLY immediate family (kids, spouse). Everyone else gets "notification with unlock button" requiring your active decision. The 10 seconds to tap "unlock" is worth the security of verifying who's actually there!
