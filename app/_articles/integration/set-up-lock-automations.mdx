## Quick Answer

**Create lock automations: Open smart home app → Automations → + New → Choose trigger (leaving home, time, sensor) → Add action (lock door) → Set conditions → Save.** Most useful: Auto-lock after 5 min unlocked, Lock when last person leaves, Unlock when arriving home (with confirmation). Test all automations before relying on them.

**Popular automations:**
1. 🔴 Auto-lock after timeout (95% use this)
2. 🟡 Lock when leaving home (70%)
3. 🟠 Scheduled lock/unlock (40%)

## Essential Automations

### 1. Auto-Lock After Unlocking

**Purpose:** Lock door automatically after being unlocked

**When to use:**
- Forgot to lock after entering
- Kids don't lock consistently
- Package delivery unlocked door

**Setup (varies by platform):**

**HomeKit:**
```
1. Home app → Automation → +
2. "An Accessory is Controlled"
3. Select lock → "When" → "Unlocked"
4. Next → Add Action
5. Select same lock → "Lock"
6. Time of Day → "After" → "5 minutes"
7. Name: "Auto-lock Front Door"
8. Done
```

**Google Home:**
```
1. Google Home app → Automation → +
2. Starter: Device → [Lock] → Unlocked
3. Action: Delay → 5 minutes
4. Then: Device → [Lock] → Lock
5. Save
```

**Alexa:**
```
1. Alexa app → More → Routines → +
2. When this happens: Smart Home → [Lock] Unlocked
3. Wait: 5 minutes
4. Add action: Smart Home → [Lock] → Lock
5. Save
```

**SmartThings:**
```
1. Automations → + → Add Routine
2. If: Device status → [Lock] → Unlocked
3. Delay: 5 minutes
4. Then: Control devices → [Lock] → Lock
5. Save
```

**Recommended delay:** 3-5 minutes (enough to get inside, not too long)

### 2. Lock When Leaving Home

**Purpose:** Auto-lock when last person leaves

**Setup (geofence):**

**HomeKit:**
```
1. Automation → + → "People Leave"
2. When: "Last Person Leaves"
3. Location: Current (home)
4. Time: Anytime
5. Add Action: Lock → [Lock Name]
6. Done
```

**Google Home:**
```
1. Automation → +
2. Starter: Home & Away → Everyone leaves
3. Action: Device → [Lock] → Lock
4. Save
```

**Alexa:**
```
Note: Requires Echo with location services
1. Routines → +
2. When: Location → You leave home
3. Add action: [Lock] → Lock
4. Save
```

**Requirements:**
- Phone location "Always" enabled
- Geofence set up  - home address
- Works when last person with app leaves

### 3. Unlock When Arriving Home

**Purpose:** Auto-unlock when arriving (with confirmation)

**⚠️ Security consideration:**
- Most platforms require confirmation
- Can't auto-unlock without authentication
- Balances convenience vs security

**Setup:**

**HomeKit:**
```
1. Automation → + → "People Arrive"
2. When: "Anyone Arrives"
3. OR: "First Person Arrives"
4. Location: Home
5. Add Action: Unlock → [Lock]
6. Important: "Ask Before Running" → ON
7. Notification appears when arriving
8. Tap to approve unlock
```

**Google Home:**
```
Requires Hub Max or Nest Hub with Face Match
1. Home & Away Routines
2. When: Someone arrives home
3. Add: Unlock [Lock]
4. Requires voice confirmation via hub
```

**Alternative: Proximity unlock in lock app**
- Many lock apps support direct proximity unlock
- No smart home platform needed
- August, Yale, Schlage apps

### 4. Schedule-Based Locking

**Purpose:** Lock/unlock at specific times

**Use cases:**
- Office: Unlock 9am, lock 6pm
- Rental: Unlock 3pm check-in, lock 11am check-out
- Daily routine: Lock 10pm, unlock 6am

**Setup:**

**HomeKit:**
```
1. Automation → + → "A Time of Day Occurs"
2. Time: 10:00 PM
3. Repeat: Daily OR select days
4. Add Action: Lock → [Lock]
5. Done

Repeat for unlock (6:00 AM)
```

**Google Home/Alexa/SmartThings:**
```
Similar process:
- Trigger: Time of day
- Days: Select which days
- Action: Lock or unlock
```

**Recommendations:**
- Bedtime lock: 10-11pm
- Morning unlock: 6-7am  - if desired
- Don't unlock automatically at night  - security

### 5. Scene-Based Automations

**"Goodnight" scene:**
```
Trigger: Say "Goodnight" OR button OR time
Actions:
- Lock all doors
- Turn off lights
- Lower thermostat
- Arm security system
- Close garage door
```

**"Leaving Home" scene:**
```
Trigger: Say "Goodbye" OR geofence
Actions:
- Lock all doors
- Turn off lights/appliances
- Adjust thermostat  - away mode
- Arm security
```

**"Arriving Home" scene:**
```
Trigger: Geofence OR say "I'm home"
Actions:
- Unlock door  - with confirmation
- Turn on entry lights
- Adjust thermostat  - home mode
- Disarm security
```

## Advanced Automations

### Conditional Automations

**Only lock if after sunset:**
```
Trigger: Unlock
Condition: After sunset
Action: Lock after 5 minutes

Why: Don't auto-lock during day when active
```

**Only unlock if you're home:**
```
Trigger: Someone arrives
Condition: Other family member already home
Action: Unlock (safe, someone inside)
```

**Temperature-based:**
```
If outside temp < 32°F:
- Delay auto-lock to 10 min  - cold weather = slower entry
```

### Multi-Device Automations

**Delivery detected:**
```
Trigger: Doorbell motion OR Ring pressed
Condition: Between 9am-5pm
Action: Send notification to unlock remotely
```

**Security integration:**
```
Trigger: Security alarm triggered
Action: Lock all doors (prevent exit)
```

### Notification Automations

**Lock status alerts:**
```
IF: Door unlocked for >30 minutes
AND: After 10pm OR nobody home
THEN: Send notification "Front door unlocked!"
```

## Testing Automations

**Before relying on automation:**

```
□ Test trigger works
  - Manually trigger condition
  - Verify automation executes

□ Test action works
  - Lock/unlock actually happens
  - Correct device controlled

□ Test timing
  - Delay works as expected
  - No premature execution

□ Test conditions
  - Only runs when supposed to
  - Doesn't run when shouldn't

□ Test edge cases
  - What if phone battery dead?
  - What if internet down?
  - What if multiple people arriving?

□ Monitor for 1 week
  - Does it work consistently?
  - Any false triggers?
  - Any missed triggers?
```

**Don't assume it works - verify!**

## Common Mistakes

```
❌ Auto-unlock without confirmation
   - Security risk
   - Most platforms prevent this

❌ Too-short auto-lock delay
   - 1 minute = Locks before you get inside
   - Use 3-5 minutes

❌ Forgetting to test
   - Automation looks good but doesn't work
   - Test thoroughly before trusting

❌ No backup access method
   - Automation fails = Locked out
   - Always have PIN/key backup

❌ Geofence too small
   - Arrives at door before automation triggers
   - Use 100-200m radius

❌ Conflicting automations
   - Auto-lock vs manual unlock battle
   - Review all automations together
```

## Troubleshooting

**Automation doesn't trigger:**
```
□ Check automation enabled (not paused)
□ Verify conditions met
□ Check device online
□ Check hub online
□ Review automation logs (if available)
□ Delete and recreate automation
```

**Automation triggers randomly:**
```
□ Check for conflicting automations
□ Review trigger conditions
□ Check for sensor false positives
□ Adjust geofence size/sensitivity
```

## Best Practices

```
☑️ Start simple
  - One automation at a time
  - Test thoroughly
  - Add complexity gradually

☑️ Name descriptively
  - "Auto-lock Front 5min"
  - Not "Automation 1"

☑️ Document automations
  - What, when, why
  - Review quarterly

☑️ Have backup access
  - Don't rely only on automation
  - PIN, key, app always available

☑️ Adjust based on usage
  - Too frequent? Lengthen delay
  - Missing triggers? Adjust conditions
```

## Summary Checklist

**Set up lock automations:**

**Essential 3:**
1. ☑️ **Auto-lock after 5 min** (unlock → delay → lock)
2. ☑️ **Lock when leaving** (geofence → last person → lock)
3. ☑️ **Unlock when arriving** (geofence → confirmation → unlock)

**Setup process:**
1. ☑️ Choose platform (HomeKit/Google/Alexa)
2. ☑️ Create automation (trigger + action)
3. ☑️ Test thoroughly (1 week monitoring)
4. ☑️ Adjust as needed (timing, conditions)

**Security:**
- Always require confirmation for unlock
- Test backup access methods
- Don't rely solely on automation

**Pro tip:** Start with JUST auto-lock after 5 minutes. Use it for 2 weeks. Once comfortable, add "lock when leaving." After another 2 weeks, consider "unlock when arriving" (with confirmation). Resist urge to set up 10 automations on day 1 - you'll create conflicts and confusion. Master one automation before adding the next. Automation is powerful but complex - respect that!
