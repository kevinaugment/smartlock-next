## Matter Locks (Newer)

  - No need to choose one platform
□ More reliable, future-proof

```

## Limitations

**HomeKit lock limitations:**
```
⚠️ Cannot unlock remotely (outside home)
  - Unless you have Home Hub
  - Security feature

⚠️ Some features require manufacturer app
  - User code management
  - Advanced settings
  - Firmware updates

⚠️ Automations require Home Hub
  - HomePod, Apple TV, or iPad
  - Must be left at home

⚠️ Geo-fence unlock requires confirmation
  - Can't auto-unlock without auth
  - Security by design
```

## Using Multiple Platforms

**HomeKit + Google Home + Alexa:**
```
Matter locks:
✅ Add to all platforms simultaneously
✅ Control from any app/voice assistant
✅ No conflicts

Non-Matter locks:
❌ Usually exclusive to one platform
❌ Must choose: HomeKit OR Google/Alexa
```

## Summary Checklist

**Add lock to HomeKit:**

1. ☑️ **Verify requirements** (iOS 16.1+, Home Hub, HomeKit lock)
2. ☑️ **Find HomeKit code** (QR or 8-digit)
3. ☑️ **Open Home app** (+ → Add Accessory)
4. ☑️ **Scan code** (or enter manually)
5. ☑️ **Follow prompts** (assign room, name)
6. ☑️ **Set permissions** (who can control)
7. ☑️ **Enable "Always" location** (for automations)
8. ☑️ **Test lock/unlock** (3-5 times)
9. ☑️ **Create automations** (optional but useful)

**Time: 2-5 minutes**

**Pro tip:** After adding lock to HomeKit, create a "Goodnight" scene that locks all doors, turns off lights, and sets thermostat. Activate with "Hey Siri, goodnight" or automatically at bedtime. HomeKit's real power is in automations and scenes - not just individual device control!
