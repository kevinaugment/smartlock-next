## Quick Answer

**After power outage: Wait 5-10 minutes for hub/router to fully restart, lock should auto-reconnect. If doesn't: Restart hub (unplug 30 sec), power cycle lock (remove batteries 30 sec), wait 2-3 minutes for mesh network to rebuild.** Hub needs 5+ min to boot fully after power restored. Z-Wave/Zigbee mesh takes additional time to re-establish routes.

**Recovery timeline:**
- Router online: 2-3 minutes
- Hub online: 3-5 minutes  
- Mesh rebuilt: 5-10 minutes
- Lock reconnects: 8-15 minutes total

## Understanding Power Outage Impact

### What Happens During Outage

```
Power goes out:
1. Router/modem offline
2. Hub offline (Zigbee/Z-Wave/Thread)
3. Lock stays functional (has batteries) ✓
   - Keypad still works
   - Manual thumb turn works
   - BUT: App control lost

Power restored:
1. Router boots (2-3 min)
2. Hub boots (3-5 min)
3. Mesh network rebuilds (5-10 min)
4. Devices reconnect gradually
```

**Lock itself unaffected** - Has battery backup

**App control lost** - Needs hub/network

## Immediate Recovery Steps

### Quick 10-Minute Recovery

```
Step 1: Wait patiently (most important)
□ Power restored? Give it 10 minutes
□ Don't rush - networks need time to stabilize
□ Check time: _____ (come back in 10 min)

Step 2: Check router online
□ Router lights normal?
□ Internet working? (test on phone)
□ If not: Restart router first

Step 3: Check hub status
□ Hub LED indicators normal?
□ Hub shows online in app?
□ If offline: Continue to Step 4

Step 4: Restart hub
□ Unplug hub (or HomePod, Apple TV)
□ Wait 30 seconds
□ Plug back in
□ Wait 5 minutes for full boot

Step 5: Test lock connection
□ Open app → Check lock status
□ Try lock/unlock command
□ Works? Done! ✓
□ Still offline? Continue to Step 6

Step 6: Power cycle lock
□ Remove all 4 batteries
□ Wait 30 seconds
□ Reinsert batteries
□ Wait 2-3 minutes
□ Lock should reconnect

Step 7: Verify connection
□ Lock shows "Online" in app
□ Test lock/unlock 3 times
□ Response time normal (<2 sec)
```

**80% of locks reconnect by Step 5**

## Protocol-Specific Recovery

### Zigbee Locks

```
Issue: Zigbee mesh needs to rebuild after power loss

Recovery:
□ Wait 10-15 minutes after power restored
□ All mains-powered devices (plugs, lights) reconnect first
□ Battery devices (lock) reconnect last
□ Be patient - automatic

If still offline:
□ Wake up lock (press keypad button)
□ Forces lock to search for network
□ Should reconnect within 2 minutes
```

### Z-Wave Locks

```
Issue: Z-Wave slower to rebuild (especially S2 secure)

Recovery:
□ Wait 15 minutes minimum
□ Z-Wave polls devices to check status
□ S2 security adds handshake time

If still offline:
□ Run "Z-Wave Network Repair" (if hub supports)
  - SmartThings: Settings → Z-Wave Utilities → Repair
  - Hubitat: Settings → Z-Wave Details → Repair
□ Takes 10-30 minutes
□ Do overnight for best results
```

### Thread Locks

```
Issue: Thread Border Router may need restart

Recovery:
□ Check Border Router online
  - HomePod mini, Apple TV, or Nest Hub
  - Must be powered on

□ Restart Border Router if needed
  - Unplug, wait 30 sec, replug

□ Thread mesh rebuilds quickly (5-10 min)
```

### WiFi Locks

```
Issue: Direct WiFi connection to router

Recovery:
□ Usually fastest (2-5 minutes)
□ No mesh to rebuild
□ Just lock → router → cloud

If still offline:
□ Check lock battery (>20%)
□ Verify WiFi network online
□ Lock may need manual reconnect:
  - App → Lock Settings → Reconnect WiFi
```

## Prevention Strategies

### UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)

**Best solution:**
```
☑️ UPS for network equipment
  - Router + modem: $50-100 UPS
  - 30-60 minutes backup power
  - Prevents disconnection during brief outages

☑️ UPS for hub
  - Zigbee/Z-Wave hub: $50-100 UPS
  - SmartThings, Hubitat, etc.
  - Keeps smart home running

Cost: $100-200 total
Benefit: Zero disruption during outages <1 hour
```

**What to protect:**
1. Modem
2. Router
3. Smart home hub
4. (Optional) NAS, security cameras

**Locks have battery backup** - Don't need UPS

### Cellular Backup

**For critical access:**
```
☑️ LTE backup router
  - Netgear LM1200, etc.
  - Switches to cellular if broadband down
  - Cost: $200 + cellular plan

☑️ Hub with cellular
  - Some hubs support LTE dongle
  - Rare but available
```

**Overkill for most** - UPS simpler and cheaper

### Scheduled Network Maintenance

**Proactive approach:**
```
☑️ Monthly restart
  - Router, hub (planned restart)
  - Ensures clean state
  - Prevents gradual degradation

☑️ Test after every outage
  - Verify all devices reconnected
  - Note which ones needed manual help
  - Document for next time
```

## Multiple Devices Offline

**If ALL smart home devices offline after outage:**

```
□ Router issue most likely
  - Restart router
  - Verify internet working
  - Check with ISP if prolonged

□ Hub issue
  - Restart hub
  - Check hub firmware

□ Network configuration lost
  - Router may have reset to defaults
  - Check WiFi password
  - Check DHCP settings
  - May need to reconfigure
```

## Temporary Workarounds

**While waiting for reconnection:**

```
✓ Use keypad PIN codes
  - Lock itself works fine
  - No network needed

✓ Use physical key
  - Always reliable

✓ Manual lock/unlock
  - Thumb turn from interior

✓ Be patient
  - Networks recover on their own
  - Forced fixes often make worse
```

## When to Call for Help

**Call ISP if:**
- Internet not restored after 2+ hours
- Router not getting signal
- Modem lights abnormal

**Call locksmith if:**
- Lock mechanically damaged during outage
- Battery died during outage  - locked out

**Contact manufacturer if:**
- Lock won't reconnect after 24 hours
- Multiple power cycles don't help
- Lock worked before outage, never recovered

## Post-Outage Checklist

```
After power restored:

□ Wait 15 minutes (be patient)

□ Verify internet working
  - Test on phone/computer

□ Check hub online
  - LED indicators
  - App shows online

□ Test lock from app
  - Lock/unlock command
  - Status updates

□ If any issues:
  - Restart hub
  - Power cycle lock
  - Wait another 10 minutes

□ Document what worked
  - For next time
  - Note any devices that needed manual intervention

□ Consider UPS
  - Prevent future issues
```

## Long Outage (>6 Hours)

**If power out for extended time:**

```
□ Lock battery OK?
  - May need replacement if was already low
  - Check level after power restored

□ Router may need ISP intervention
  - Prolonged outage can cause network issues

□ Hub may need reconfiguration
  - Rare but possible
  - Factory reset and restore backup (last resort)

□ Security system armed during outage?
  - May need to disarm
  - May have triggered alerts
```

## Summary Checklist

**Reconnect lock after power outage:**

1. ☑️ **Wait 10-15 minutes** (networks need time)
2. ☑️ **Check internet working** (router online)
3. ☑️ **Check hub online** (LED indicators)
4. ☑️ **Restart hub** (unplug 30 sec)
5. ☑️ **Power cycle lock** (remove batteries 30 sec)
6. ☑️ **Wait 3-5 minutes** (reconnection time)
7. ☑️ **Test lock/unlock** (verify working)

**Most important:** Patience - networks recover automatically given time

**Prevention:** $100 UPS prevents 90% of outage issues

**Pro tip:** After EVERY power outage (even brief flickers), check your smart lock status within an hour. Don't wait until you need it and discover it's offline. Quick test: Open app, verify "Online", send one lock/unlock command. Takes 30 seconds now, saves hours of frustration later. If offline, restart hub immediately while you remember - don't put it off!
