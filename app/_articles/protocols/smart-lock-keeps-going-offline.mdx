## Quick Answer

**Locks going offline repeatedly = weak signal (RSSI < -75 dBm). Solution: Add Zigbee/Z-Wave repeater between lock and hub ($25-40). This fixes 70% of offline issues immediately.**

**Root causes:**
- Weak signal: 70%
- Mesh network gaps: 15%
- Hub/router issues: 10%
- Lock hardware: 5%

## Check Signal Strength First

**In your lock app:**
1. Open lock settings
2. Find "Signal Strength" or "RSSI"
3. Check value:
   - -60 dBm or better = Excellent ✅
   - -65 to -75 dBm = Fair ⚠️
   - Below -75 dBm = Poor ❌ (needs repeater)

**If RSSI unavailable:** Count offline incidents
- 1-2/month = Marginal signal
- 1-2/week = Poor signal
- Daily = Critical signal issue

## Quick Fixes (Try First)

### 1. Reboot Everything (15 min)
```
Step 1: Remove lock batteries → wait 30 sec → reinstall
Step 2: Unplug hub → wait 30 sec → plug back in
Step 3: Reboot WiFi router
Step 4: Wait 5 minutes for mesh rebuild
Step 5: Test lock in app
```

**Success rate:** 20% (if temporary glitch)

### 2. Move Hub Closer (30 min)
```
Current distance > 40 feet?
→ Move hub to location 20-30 feet from lock
→ Test for 24 hours
→ If fixed, make permanent
```

**Success rate:** 30% (if marginal signal)

### 3. Add Repeater (1 hour)
```
Buy: Zigbee or Z-Wave plug-in repeater ($25-40)
Install: Plug in halfway between hub and lock
Wait: 15 min for mesh network to rebuild
Test: Lock should show stronger signal
```

**Success rate:** 70% (most effective solution)

## Diagnose Root Cause

### Test Signal Path

**Walk hub to lock:**
1. Unplug hub
2. Move it progressively closer to lock
3. Plug in at each test point
4. Check if lock connects
5. Identify minimum working distance

**This tells you:**
- If 40+ feet works = Hub/router issue
- If 20 feet works = Need repeater
- If <10 feet required = Severe interference

### Check Interference

**Common blockers:**
- Metal doors/frames
- Concrete/brick walls
- Large appliances (fridge, washer)
- WiFi router too close (creates interference)
- Microwave ovens

**Test:** Temporarily move hub to different location away from metal/appliances

## Permanent Solutions

### Best: Add Mesh Repeaters

**Zigbee locks:**
- Philips Hue bulb (doubles as repeater)
- IKEA Tradfri plug
- Sonoff Zigbee plug
- Cost: $15-30 each

**Z-Wave locks:**
- Aeotec Range Extender 7
- Ring Alarm Range Extender
- Any Z-Wave smart plug
- Cost: $25-50 each

**Placement:**
- Halfway between hub and lock
- Avoid metal obstacles
- Plugged in 24/7 (not switched outlet)

### Alternative: Move Hub

**If repeater not desired:**
1. Find central location 20-30 feet from lock
2. Ensure hub has Ethernet/WiFi there
3. Relocate hub permanently
4. Verify lock stays online 7+ days

## Protocol-Specific Issues

### Zigbee Going Offline

**Channel interference with WiFi:**
```
Problem: WiFi on channels 1, 6, 11 overlaps Zigbee
Solution: Change Zigbee to channel 15, 20, or 25
How: Hub settings → Zigbee → Change channel
```

**Router table full:**
- Zigbee routers have device limits (20-40)
- Too many devices = dropped connections
- Solution: Add more repeaters to distribute load

### Z-Wave Going Offline

**Network congestion:**
- Max 232 devices per controller
- Near limit = reliability issues
- Solution: Remove unused devices

**Ghost nodes:**
- Failed device removals leave "ghosts"
- Causes network confusion
- Solution: Factory reset hub (last resort)

## Summary

**Offline locks = weak signal.** Don't tolerate repeated disconnections—they indicate marginal signal strength that will worsen over time as batteries drain. The correct solution is infrastructure (add repeater) not endless troubleshooting. A $30 repeater solves 70% of offline issues permanently.

**Action steps:**
1. Check signal strength (RSSI)
2. If < -75 dBm, add repeater immediately
3. Place halfway between hub and lock
4. Verify lock stays online for 7 days
5. Done!

**Don't waste time on:** Firmware updates, factory resets, or "optimizations" until you fix signal strength first. Infrastructure solves offline issues, not configuration tweaks.
