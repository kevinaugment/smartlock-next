## Threat Model: Understanding Attack Vectors {#threat-model}

### Attack Surface Analysis

Smart locks introduce **multiple attack vectors** compared to traditional locks:

```
Traditional Lock: 1 attack vector
└─ Physical attack (pick, bump, drill)

Smart Lock: 5 attack vectors
├─ Physical attack (lock mechanism)
├─ Wireless attack (RF interception)
├─ Network attack (hub/cloud)
├─ Application attack (mobile app)
└─ Supply chain (firmware backdoors)
```

**Critical understanding:** More attack vectors ≠ less secure. **Each vector has different difficulty and likelihood.**

### Real-World Attack Likelihood

Based on 200+ reported vulnerabilities (2015-2024):

| Attack Vector | Likelihood | Skill Required | Cost | Detection Risk |
|--------------|------------|----------------|------|----------------|
| **Physical picking** | High | Low | $20 | Low |
| **Wireless replay** | Low | Medium | $150 | Medium |
| **Network intrusion** | Very Low | High | Varies | High |
| **App exploitation** | Very Low | High | $0 | High |
| **Supply chain** | Extremely Low | Very High | N/A | Certain |

**Reality check:** 95% of smart lock "hacks" require physical access to lock + specialized tools. Remote attacks are exceedingly rare for consumer locks.

### Attack Difficulty Comparison

**Easier than traditional locks:**
- ❌ Default PIN codes (if not changed)
- ❌ Unencrypted older models (pre-2017)
- ❌ Exposed debug ports (JTAG/SWD)

**Similar to traditional locks:**
- ≈ Physical lock picking (smart locks use same mechanisms)
- ≈ Destructive entry (drilling, prying)

**Harder than traditional locks:**
- ✅ Modern encrypted wireless (AES-128 with rolling codes)
- ✅ Cloud authentication (multi-factor possible)
- ✅ Audit logging (detectable attempts)

## Protocol Security Comparison

### Encryption Standards

| Protocol | Encryption | Key Management | Replay Protection | Certification |
|----------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **WiFi** | TLS 1.2+ | Cloud-managed | Timestamp/nonce | Varies |
| **Zigbee 3.0** | AES-128 CCM | Network key + link keys | Sequence numbers | Required |
| **Z-Wave S2** | AES-128 | 3-tier model | Rolling codes | Mandatory |
| **Thread/Matter** | AES-128 CCM | Certificate-based | IPv6 security | Required |

### Z-Wave S2: Gold Standard {#zwave-s2}

**Why Z-Wave S2 is considered most secure:**

**Three-tier security model:**

1. **S2 Unauthenticated** (lowest)
   - Basic AES-128 encryption
   - No device verification
   - **NOT allowed for locks**

2. **S2 Authenticated** (medium)
   - AES-128 + DSK verification
   - Protected from MITM attacks
   - **Permitted but not recommended for locks**

3. **S2 Access Control** (highest)
   - **REQUIRED for all Z-Wave locks**
   - Mandatory DSK authentication
   - Encrypted commands
   - Tamper detection
   - Secure firmware updates
   - Audit logging

**DSK (Device Specific Key) Authentication:**

```
Pairing Process:
1. Start inclusion on hub
2. Activate lock pairing mode
3. Hub requests lock's DSK
4. USER verifies first 5 digits of DSK
   (printed on lock or manual)
5. Secure pairing completes
```

**This prevents:** Attacker from injecting rogue device during pairing window.

**Real-world impact:** All Z-Wave locks since 2017 support S2 Access Control. Older S0 locks should be upgraded.

### Zigbee 3.0 Security

**Key features:**
- AES-128 encryption (same as Z-Wave)
- Install codes for secure pairing
- Network key + individual link keys

**Difference from Z-Wave:**
- Network key is shared (all devices)
- Z-Wave S2 uses unique keys per device
- **Compromise risk:** Zigbee network key compromise = all devices at risk

**Mitigation:** Change network key periodically, use install codes

### WiFi Security Layers

**Multi-layered protection:**

1. **WiFi layer:** WPA2/WPA3
2. **Transport layer:** TLS 1.2+ (HTTPS/MQTT)
3. **Application layer:** AES-128/256 for commands
4. **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 / JWT tokens

**Vulnerability points:**
- ☁️ Cloud server breach (manufacturer responsibility)
- 📱 Phone app compromise
- 🏠 Home network intrusion

**Best practice:** Choose reputable manufacturers with strong security track record.

## Penetration Testing Your Smart Lock

### DIY Security Assessment

**Self-audit checklist (30 minutes):**

```
Physical Security Test:
├─ [ ] Try credit card bypass on latch
├─ [ ] Inspect strike plate installation (3" screws?)
├─ [ ] Check door/frame gaps (<1/8 inch)
├─ [ ] Verify deadbolt full extension
└─ [ ] Test physical key override functionality

Digital Security Test:
├─ [ ] Attempt default PIN (1234, 0000)
├─ [ ] Try 5+ failed PIN attempts (lockout enabled?)
├─ [ ] Check firmware version (up to date?)
├─ [ ] Review audit logs (enabled? accessible?)
└─ [ ] Test battery dead scenario (9V backup works?)

Network Security Test (WiFi locks):
├─ [ ] Verify cloud account has 2FA enabled
├─ [ ] Check password strength (>16 chars, unique?)
├─ [ ] Test offline functionality (internet disconnected)
├─ [ ] Scan for open ports (nmap if technical)
└─ [ ] Review connected devices in router

Configuration Security Test:
├─ [ ] All default PINs changed?
├─ [ ] Auto-lock enabled?
├─ [ ] Tamper alerts configured?
├─ [ ] User access list reviewed (remove old users)?
└─ [ ] Backup access methods tested?

Score:
├─ 18-20 checks passed: EXCELLENT security posture
├─ 14-17 checks passed: GOOD security, minor improvements
├─ 10-13 checks passed: FAIR security, action required
└─ <10 checks passed: POOR security, urgent remediation
```

### Professional Penetration Testing

**When to hire professional pen-testers:**

- Enterprise deployments (>50 locks)
- High-value properties ($1M+)
- Compliance requirements (HIPAA, PCI)
- Post-incident security validation
- Annual security audits

**Typical pen-test scope:**
```
Physical Testing:
├─ Lock picking attempts (30 min test)
├─ Destructive entry simulation
├─ Bypass techniques (shim, card)
└─ Tamper detection verification

Wireless Testing:
├─ RF capture and replay attacks
├─ Protocol downgrade attempts
├─ Jamming and DoS testing
└─ Range and RSSI mapping

Network Testing (WiFi):
├─ Man-in-the-middle attacks
├─ Cloud account enumeration
├─ API fuzzing and injection
└─ Mobile app reverse engineering

Social Engineering:
├─ Phishing for credentials
├─ Insider threat simulation
├─ Physical access pretexting
└─ Support call manipulation
```

**Expected cost:** $2,000-8,000 for comprehensive test of single-property deployment.

**Deliverable:** Detailed report with findings, CVSS scores, and remediation recommendations.

## Incident Response Planning

### Security Incident Classification

**Severity levels:**

```
CRITICAL (P0): Immediate response required
├─ Active unauthorized access detected
├─ Lock completely compromised
├─ Data breach (user credentials)
└─ Response time: <15 minutes

HIGH (P1): Urgent attention needed
├─ Suspicious access patterns
├─ Multiple failed auth attempts
├─ Firmware compromise suspected
└─ Response time: <1 hour

MEDIUM (P2): Investigate promptly
├─ Lost/stolen phone with lock access
├─ Former user still has access
├─ Audit log anomalies
└─ Response time: <4 hours

LOW (P3): Monitor and schedule
├─ Outdated firmware
├─ Weak PIN detected
├─ Missing security configurations
└─ Response time: <24 hours
```

### Incident Response Playbook
