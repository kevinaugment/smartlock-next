## Long-Term Rentals vs Short-Term (Airbnb)

### Key Differences

| Aspect | Short-Term (Airbnb) | Long-Term Rental |
|--------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Tenant turnover** | Weekly/daily | Annual/multi-year |
| **Code changes** | After each guest | Once per tenant |
| **Access duration** | Days | Months/years |
| **Emergency access** | Frequent | Rare |
| **Automation** | Essential | Nice-to-have |
| **Integration** | PMS required | Optional |
| **Tenant education** | Minimal | Important |
| **Lock features** | Temporary codes | Permanent codes |

**Key insight:** Long-term rentals need **reliability and tenant-friendliness** over automation features.

## Benefits for Landlords

### Time Savings

**Traditional key handoff:**
- Schedule meeting time (15-30 min)
- Drive to property (15-60 min)
- Meet tenant (10-20 min)
- Explain usage (5-10 min)
- **Total: 45-120 minutes per turnover**

**Smart lock handoff:**
- Generate code remotely (2 min)
- Send code via text/email (1 min)
- **Total: 3 minutes**

**Annual savings (4 properties, 50% turnover):**
- Traditional: 2 turnovers × 4 units × 60 min = 8 hours
- Smart lock: 2 turnovers × 4 units × 3 min = 24 minutes
- **Time saved: 7.5 hours/year**

**Value:** $200-400/year (at $25-50/hour)

### Cost Savings

**Locksmith calls eliminated:**
- Lost keys: $150-300 per call
- Tenant lockouts: $150-300 per call
- Rekey after move-out: $80-150 per unit
- **Typical: 1-3 incidents/year per 4-unit portfolio = $300-900/year**

**Key replacement:**
- Traditional: $5-10 per key set × 2 turnover/year × 4 units = $40-80
- Smart lock: $0
- **Savings: $40-80/year**

**Total annual savings:** $340-980 for 4-unit portfolio

## Tenant Management Strategy

### Initial Move-In Process

**Week before move-in:**
1. Test lock operation
2. Replace batteries if <50%
3. Generate tenant code
4. Test code works
5. Document in property management system

**Move-in day:**
1. Send welcome email with:
   - Door code
   - Physical key location
   - Lock usage instructions
   - Emergency contact
   - Battery replacement policy

**Example move-in email:**
```
Welcome to [ADDRESS]!

Your door code is: [CODE]
Valid starting: [DATE]

How to use:
1. Enter code on keypad: [CODE]
2. Press checkmark (✓)
3. Turn handle when beep sounds
4. Door auto-locks in 30 seconds

Physical key backup:
- One key provided
- Additional keys: $20 each

Important:
- Code is private (don't share)
- Report issues immediately
- Low battery: Contact landlord
- Lost key: $50 replacement fee

Questions? Call: [PHONE]
```

### Ongoing Access Management

**Permanent code approach (recommended):**
- Tenant keeps same code for entire lease
- Simple for tenant (no changes)
- Less landlord management
- Change code at move-out

**Rotating code approach:**
- Change code every 6-12 months
- Higher security
- More landlord management
- Use if security concerns

### Move-Out Process

**Tenant move-out:**
1. Schedule move-out inspection
2. Collect physical key
3. Delete tenant code immediately
4. Generate landlord access code
5. Verify lock operation
6. Replace batteries if needed

**Turnover preparation:**
1. Deep clean showing
2. Verify lock works perfectly
3. Generate new tenant code
4. Ready for new tenant

---

## Emergency Access Strategy

### Why Emergency Access Matters

**Common scenarios:**
- Maintenance emergency (water leak, gas smell)
- Tenant lockout (lost key + forgot code)
- Showing property (tenant not home)
- Safety check (welfare check)
- Eviction access (last resort)

### Emergency Access Methods

**1. Landlord master code**
- Permanent code for landlord
- Different from tenant code
- Never share with tenant
- Document usage (audit trail)

**2. Physical key**
- Keep spare at secure location
- Not on-site (security)
- Document key location
- Emergency only

**3. Remote unlock (some locks)**
- Unlock via app
- Generate temporary code
- Useful for showing property
- Requires WiFi/hub connectivity

### Emergency Access Policy

**Document in lease:**
```
Emergency Access:
Landlord maintains emergency access to property via:
1. Landlord access code (for inspections)
2. Physical key (for emergencies)

Landlord will provide 24-hour notice for non-emergency entry.
Emergency situations (leak, fire, safety) may require immediate access.

Tenant is responsible for:
- Maintaining door code privacy
- Notifying landlord of lock issues
- Not changing or adding locks without permission
```

---

## Multi-Property Management

### Scaling to 5+ Properties

**Centralized code management:**

**Option 1: Spreadsheet (1-10 units)**
```
Property | Unit | Tenant | Code | Start Date | End Date | Status
123 Main | A    | Smith  | 1234 | 1/1/24     | 12/31/24 | Active
123 Main | B    | Jones  | 5678 | 2/1/24     | 1/31/25  | Active
```

**Option 2: Property management software (10+ units)**
- Buildium
- AppFolio
- TenantCloud
- Propertyware

**Integration:** Some PMS integrate with smart locks automatically.

### Hub Placement Strategies

**Option 1: One hub per property**
- Best reliability
- No range issues
- Higher cost ($50-70 per hub)
- **Best for:** Properties >300 feet apart

**Option 2: One hub for multiple units (same building)**
- Cost-effective
- Manage all units centrally
- Must be within range
- **Best for:** Duplex, triplex, apartments

**Example duplex setup:**
```
SmartThings Hub (Unit A)
├─ Lock: Unit A front door
└─ Lock: Unit B front door (via mesh router)
```

### Battery Maintenance at Scale

**Proactive replacement schedule:**

**10-unit portfolio:**
- Zigbee/Z-Wave: 10 locks × 1 change/year = 10 changes/year
- WiFi: 10 locks × 4 changes/year = 40 changes/year

**Monthly calendar:**
- Month 1: Properties 1-2 (January)
- Month 2: Properties 3-4 (February)
- Month 3: Properties 5-6 (March)
- Etc.

**Bulk battery purchase:**
- Buy 50-100 AA batteries at once
- Costco/Amazon bulk pricing
- Keep supply in vehicle
- Replace multiple units per visit

---

## Tenant Education & Support

### Move-In Demonstration

**In-person (preferred):**
1. Show keypad location
2. Demonstrate code entry (slowly)
3. Show auto-lock feature
4. Explain physical key backup
5. Demonstrate low battery behavior
6. Provide printed instructions

**Video alternative:**
- Record short demo video (2-3 min)
- Upload to YouTube (unlisted)
- Send link to tenant
- Supplement written instructions

### Common Tenant Issues

**Issue 1: "Code not working"**

**Troubleshooting script:**
```
1. Enter code slowly (1 second between digits)
2. Press checkmark/enter after code
3. Turn handle immediately after beep
4. Try physical key (verify lock works mechanically)
5. If code still fails, landlord will generate new code
```

**Issue 2: "Battery dead"**

**Prevention:**
- Replace at 30% (not 10%)
- Landlord responsibility (lease clause)
- Quarterly checks for WiFi locks
- Annual checks for mesh locks

**Response:**
- 9V battery emergency power (if supported)
- Physical key access
- Landlord emergency visit

**Issue 3: "Forgot code"**

**Policy:**
- Tenant responsibility to remember code
- Written in move-in documents
- Landlord can provide once (free)
- Additional requests: $25 fee (discourage carelessness)
